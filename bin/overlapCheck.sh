   run the root overlap check, return error code if the process failed
   or if overlaps were detected.
   if GDMLFILE argument is not proesent, look in the Muse standard location
   \$MUSE_BUILD_DIR/Offline/gen/gdml/muse.gdml.

   -q don't print the full output, only errors

   -b if no GDMLFILE provided, try to build it in Muse standard location
      then run checks on it
