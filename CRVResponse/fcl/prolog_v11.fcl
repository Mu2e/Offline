//The CRV-Cryo-Inner modules get a scintillation yield of 0 to disable these modules.
//These modules cannot be removed from the geometry because it would make older files incompatible with the new geometry.
//The geometry in Mu2eG4/geom/crv_counters_v09.txt uses a CRV counter cross section of 51.30mm x 19.80mm,
//while the v6_0 lookup tables use a cross section of 51.34mm x 19.78mm.
//The TiO2 coating of the CRV counters has a thickness of 0.25mm so that the active volume of the lookup table counters
//is fully covered by the Offline counters.
