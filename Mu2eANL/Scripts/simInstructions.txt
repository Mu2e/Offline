Install teststand simulation files:
cp /mu2e/users/nmesmer/workDir/Offline/CRVResponse/efficiencyCheck/genconfig_L_teststand.txt CRVResponse/efficiencyCheck
cp /mu2e/users/nmesmer/workDir/Offline/CRVResponse/efficiencyCheck/geom_L_teststand.txt CRVResponse/efficiencyCheck


Delete all lines except for first line of CRVResponse/efficiencyCheck/jobs.sh (This step doesn't apply to running this for the first time)
Remove all files from CRVResponse/efficiencyCheck/submit (This step doesn't apply to running this for the first time)

Make sure the format of Mu2eANL/Scripts/CRV_Efficiency_check_submit.sh is correct:
- Proper PE range, correct number of events, --njobs is set reasonably.

source Mu2eANL/Scripts/CRV_Efficiency_check_submit.sh

gridexport

Copy the file location onto the first line of CRVResponse/efficiencyCheck/jobs.sh


In a new terminal window (This may have been fixed and the same terminal window might work now)
setup mu2egrid v6_09_00
source CRVResponse/efficiencyCheck/jobs.sh
