AmbigResolver : {
  fixed   : 0 # Fixed resolver for initialization and special tests
  poca    : 1 # Original BaBar code embedded resolver (historical only, don't use !!!)
  hit   : 2 # Individual hit based resolver
  panel   : 3 # resolve all hits in a panel coherently, including activation/deactivation
  doublet : 4 # resolve hits in pairs
}

# allowed states for hit ambiguity, used by some algorithms
AmbigState : {
  negambig  : -1 # negative ambiguity, signed by track angular momentum around the wire
  noambig : 0
  posambig  : 1
  inactive  : 2 # not strictly an ambiguity state, but used in ambiguity resolvers.
