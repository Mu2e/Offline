16) February 17, 2012 mjlee

    ParticleGun and ParticleGunImpl classes are modified to be able to
    generate various momentum and source distributions. See docdb-2049
    for details.

    First release of these files.  Given a Poisson mean then compute
    a sensible histogram binning for a histogram that will monitor
    a distribution generated with this mean.

     - The random engine is now reseeded in the c'tor of the MixDetail class.
       The RandPoissonQ object was static function local in the nSecondaries()
       method of the details class.  This was wrong - it always used the engine
       from the first instantiation and never picked up the other engines.
       That object is now member data of each MixDetail object.
     - Also added diagnostic histograms.

    SeedService/src/SeedService_service.cc
     - Restored the test to ensure that getSeed is only called from the
       c'tor or beginRun methods.

    An option to visualize magnetic field map regions.

12) February 10, 2012, gandr

    New geometry parameter hall.wallExtMonUCIThick

11) February 10, 2012, gandr

    Rename the preDefined SeedService policy to preDefinedOffset.
    Add new policies preDefinedSeed and linearMapping.

   fcl/standardServices.fcl
     - Default values for baseSeed and maxUniqueEngines have been set to nil
       so that users are forced to initialize them in their jobs.

   Mu2eG4/test/beamline_01.fcl
               beamline_02.fcl
               g4test_01.fcl
               g4test_02.fcl
               g4test_03.fcl

    Add lines to initialize baseSeed and maxUniqueEngines .

   SeedService/src/SeedService_module.cc
     Due to limitations in the MixFilter template we need to use getSeed
     inside the produce method.  Remove the requirement that getSeed may
     only be called from the c'tor or beginRun method.  We plan to
     restore the requirement once MixFilter is fixed.

   Remove cosmicDYB from this example and add ejectedProtonGun.  The
   reason is that cosmicDYB has a very slow initialization, more than
   1 CPU minute. I wanted to keep a generator that makes positive tracks
   for pedagodical purposes.

   Bug fix the default maximum enegry, was 0.1 MeV and is now 300 MeV.
    EventGenerator/src/EjectedProtonGun.cc

5) February 8, 2012, kutschke
   Changed default cos(theta) range to [-1.0,1.0] in many places:
      EventGenerator/src/ConversionGun.cc
      EventGenerator/src/ParticleGun.cc

4) February 8, 2012, kutschke
   Removed many obsolete files.

   Many .py files. When we bulk translated the .py files to .fcl
   files, not all .fcl files were checked.  I have kept the .py for .fcl
   files that I have not personally checked.

   Mu2eG4/test/g4test_04* are obsolete and were removed.

   fcl/standardProducers.fcl
      wrapFiles is now the default for all mixing parmeter sets

2) February 8, 2012, kutschke
   This script was added a few days ago but this is the first
   release that is actually read for production use.
   Added tests and fixed a bug in the computation of the base seed.
     bin/updateFCLFile.sh

   Switch all random number engines to using the SeedService.
   This touches all _module files, several SConscript files
   and many .fcl files.  Some fcl files still need to be converted.

   For introductory information seed:
     http://mu2e.fnal.gov/atwork/computing/RandomBasics.shtml

   For complete details see:
      http://mu2e.fnal.gov/atwork/computing/Random.shtml

   New files:
   fcl/standardServices.fcl - define two standard configurations

   I took the opportunity to remove tabs from many files, remove stale
   or inappropriate comments and and to perform some other housekeeping.


   Add SeedService_service to the link list.

   Get seeds from the SeedService. Reorder includes; untabify.

   Remove obsolte seed : [value] parameters. Add SeedService.
   Lots of housekeeping.
