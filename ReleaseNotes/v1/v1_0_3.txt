           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v1_0_3


7) June 6, 2011 mf
   Rename Incident to SubEvent. Still work in progress.

6) June 5, 2011 kutschke
   Add code to trace the sequence of operations when data products are added to the
   event or read from the event.
     Sandbox/inc/TracerProduct.hh
     Sandbox/src/TracerProduct.cc
     Sandbox/src/MakeTracerProduct00_module.cc
     Sandbox/src/MakeVectorTracerProduct00_module.cc
     Sandbox/src/ReadTracerProduct00_module.cc
     Sandbox/src/ReadVectorTracerProduct00_module.cc
     Sandbox/src/classes_def.xml
     Sandbox/src/classes.h

5) June 4, 2011 kutschke
   Make a Sandbox directory that I can use to play with new ideas.
   The first thing added is code to test making a transient only data product
   that contains bare pointers to other objects in the event.
     Sandbox/inc/TransientProduct00Collection.hh
     Sandbox/inc/TransientProduct00.hh
     Sandbox/src/MakeTransientProduct00_module.cc
     Sandbox/src/ReadTransientProduct00_module.cc
     Sandbox/test/transientProductTest00.fcl
     Sandbox/test/transientProductTest01.fcl
     Sandbox/src/classes_def.xml
     Sandbox/src/classes.h

4) June 3, 2011 kutschke
   The code that depends on the BaBar code, currently only KalmanTests, is
   only built if the BaBar code is present.  SConstruct was modified to test 
   for the presence of the BaBar code and, if it is absent, to remove 
   KalmanTest/src/SConscript from the build list.

   KalmanTest/src/SConscript now exists and SConscript.sav is gone

3) June 2, 2011 kutschke
   Modified KalmanTests package to work with art.
   Added a cint script to test make plots.
   SConscript is still disabled.

2) June 2, 2011 dbrown
   Complete replacement for KalmanTests.  This now runs a development snapshot
   of how to use the BaBar Kalman filter.  This version works with the old
   framework: setupmu2e-v1.sh

   SConscript is still renamed to SConscript.sav so that it will not build by default.

1) June 1, 2011 kutschke
   Add code to test art::Ptr.
       Analyses/src/PtrTest0_module.cc
       Analyses/test/ptrTeset0.fcl
   ( One of the commits included features that only work with art v00_07_09.
     Had to back these out until that version of art is generally available. )
