9) November 19, 2011 kutschke
   In the last 10 days there have been many changes in development code
   that do not affect main line production.
      - brownd - Kalman filter development
      - gandr  - Extinction monitor (FNAL design) development

   Added:  fcl/artBugFix01.fcl
   This script is needed to make files written with art v0_* readable with
   art v1_*.  To use it, run with mu2e v1_1_2 or higher and:

   mu2e -c fcl/artBugFix01.fcl -s oldfile.root -o newfile.root

   - Geometry file now defines position of the Mu2e reference frame
     w.r.t the inside of the hall.  G4 world size and offset are derived.

   - All "real object" parameters are moved from WorldG4 into a new
     class Mu2eBuilding.  All remaining accessors in WorldG4 provide
     information in the G4 world frame.

   G4Helper now has a link time dependence on the geometry service.
   This was introduced in item 3 or 4.  Add this to the SConstruct.

   -added PointTrajectories to SimParticles which were not produced by "g4run" modules

   - VolumeInfo does not need to depend on Mu2eWorld for initialization.

3) November 2, 2011 gandr

   - Get rid of some static members and reduce coupling between
     classes: sensitive detectors can initialize themselves instead of
     relying on Mu2eWorld.

   - Remove public access to mu2eOriginInWorld from VolumeInfo.  The
     authoritative public source is geometry svc.

   - Move pieces of G4-specific geometry info from Mu2eWorld into an
     new geometry svc class WorldG4.

   - Remove PrimaryProtonGun parameters from Mu2eWorld and provide
     access to equivalent info through the new ProductionTarget
     geometry object.

   - Get rid of the WorldInfo class.

   -removed unused variables

   setup.sh
     - Moved to art v1_00_02 to get past the error reading back default
       constructed art::Ptr<T>.
