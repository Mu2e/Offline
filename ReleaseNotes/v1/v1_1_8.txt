           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v1_1_8

29) April 25, 2012 gandr

    A more realistic description of conventional construction relevant
    for ExtMonFNAL.  ExtMonFNAL elements are taken out of of
    ProtonBeamDump and put into new class ExtMonFNALBuilding.

    Affected code includes WorldG4, Mu2eBuilding and ProtonBeamDump
    related stuff.

28) April 24, 2012 youzy

    Add a Filter module for events with ExtMonUCI hits.
    Added
      Filters/src/ExtMonUCIFilter_module.cc
    Add Filter module in 
      Mu2eG4/test/extmon_uci_protongensim_01.fcl
      Mu2eG4/test/extmon_uci_sim_01.fcl

    FoilParticleGenerator can use different algorithms to extract foil,
    position and time to generate particles. Now the different options
    can be selected in the fcl file
    Looking at 
    EventGenerator/inc/FoilParticleGenerator.hh
    one can look at the names of the differents allowed algorithm.
    The default options have not been changed. 

26) April 20, 2012 gandr

    Moved PS_FrontExit virtual detector to make it adjacent to the PS
    enclosure end plate (on the vacuum side).

25) April 19, 2012 genser

    Added 
      mucapture/CMakeLists.txt
    which is a cmake file for Geant4 testing (should be transparent to scons)

24) April 19, 2012 genser

    Enabled seting up of geant4 9.5.p01 and 9.4.p02
    Added    setup_g4951.sh 
      which sets up geant4 9.5.p01 and other new products e.g. art, clhep
    Modified 
             Mu2eG4/src/SConscript
             mucapture/src/SConscript
    to allow for a build time selection of the Geant4 libraries depending on
    the environment setup by the setup.sh/setup_g4951.sh files.

    The modifications should be transparent to those who will only use
    setup.sh (and stay with Geant4 9.4.p02) 

23) April 19, 2012 genser

    Corrected interfacing with Geant4 (mainly affecting visualization).
      Mu2eG4/src/Mu2eG4RunManager.cc
        Corrected assignment to numberOfEventToBeProcessed
      Mu2eG4/src/G4_module.cc
        Removed no longer needed visualization commands
      Mu2eG4/test/vis45.mac
        Optimized, added vis commands, added comments

22) April 18, 2012 onoratog

    A new module
    EventGenerator/src/FromSimParticleEndPoint_module.cc

    An example fcl for the module is in
    EventGenerator/test/FromSPEndPointTest.fcl

    It is a generator that can create new particles with a given genId 
    (taken from the one already existing) using position and time from 
    the endpoint of simparticle from a previous job.
    As module parameter one have to give the PdgId(s) of the particle(s) 
    you want to look at in the input job, the volume(s) you are interested,
    the end process code to look for and the GenId of the particle to create. 
    The module will look in the input job, searching for all the particle 
    of the given pdgId, which die in the given volume with the given end
    process code.
    From the end time and end position of the selected simparticle, it 
    creates a new particle with the given GenId.

    So far the module has been implemented only for production of picaptures

    See doc-db 2210 for further information

    Other changes needed to make the module work:

      - A class to navigate through input and present.
      - The generation of momentum and energy for PiCapture has been 
        factorized in a class
      - Mu2eUtilities/inc/PiCaptureEffects.cc  (name could change soon)
      - Now both the standard picapture generator and this new module 
        use that class.
      - A new GenId has been added PiCaptureCombined


21) April 17, 2012 gandr

    Re-structure top levels of geometry to decouple the height of the
    experimental hall from vertical dimensions of proton beam dump and
    ExtMonFNAL room.  Update some hall/dirt geometry parameters per
    current civil drawings.

20) April 10, 2012 kutschke
    It is now possible to disable the calorimeter in the geometry service
    and run the code.  The changes are to disable the calorimeter related
    sensitive detectors if the calorimeter is not present.
      Mu2eG4/src/Mu2eWorld.cc
      Mu2eG4/src/G4_module.cc

19) April 11, 2012 brownd
    ConditonsService,HitMakers,KalmanTrack
    Added t2d and d2t functions to TrackerCalibraions, and used those to
    remove explicit module parameters of drift velocity and resolution. The
    existing model for t2d is extremely crude and unphysical, but it should be
    possible to replice the implementation without changing the interface or
    modifying downstream code.

18) April 10, 2012 kutschke
    Added a new accessor, get(), to GeometryService/inc/GeomHandle.hh

17) April 10, 2012 ehrlich
    CosmicRayShieldGeom/src/CosmicRayShieldMaker.cc
    CosmicRayShieldGeom/inc/CosmicRayShieldMaker.hh
    Mu2eG4/test/geom_01.txt
    Mu2eBuildingGeom/inc/Mu2eBuilding.hh
    Mu2eBuildingGeom/src/Mu2eBuildingMaker.cc

    Moved back to previous geometry.

16) April 10, 2012 kutschke
    All modules/services that use a SimpleConfig object to get some of
    their run time configuration have two new run time parameters in
    their parameter set.  The names and default values are:

      allowReplacement     : true
      messageOnReplacement : true

    These values have been default for a long time but there was no way to
    change them at run time until now.

    If the first is set to true then an existing parameter may be overriden
    by a subsequent definition ( the last definition always wins ).  If it
    is set to false then a second defintion of a parameter cause the program
    to stop.  If the first parameter is true, then second parameter controls
    whether or not a message will be given to announce the redefinition.

    ConditionsService/src/ConditionsService_service.cc
    ConditionsService/src/GlobalConstantsService_service.cc
    EventGenerator/src/EventGenerator_module.cc
    EventGenerator/src/G4BeamlineGenerator_module.cc
    GeometryService/inc/GeometryService.hh
    GeometryService/src/GeometryService_service.cc

    Also add these parameters, with their default values, to the
    parameter sets in:
      fcl/standardProducers.fcl
      Mu2eG4/test/beamline_01.fcl
      Mu2eG4/test/beamline_02.fcl
      Mu2eG4/test/g4test_03.fcl

    Mu2eBuildingGeom/inc/Mu2eBuilding.hh
    Mu2eBuildingGeom/src/Mu2eBuildingMaker.cc

    -The concrete walls/ceiling/floor of the detector hall got an
    additional corner to make it more realistic.
    -The dirt overburden is gone - only a 3ft concrete ceiling is left.
    -The bottom section of the cosmic ray shield was removed and
    the dimensions of the other sections were updated.

14) April 09, 2012 kutschke
    EventGenerator/defaultConfigs/ejectedNeutronGun.txt
       Default value of ejectedNeutronGun.mean is now -1.

    EventGenerator/inc/EjectedNeutronGun.hh
    EventGenerator/src/EjectedNeutronGun.cc
      No functional changes.
      Fixed binning on diagnostics histograms and cleaned up targets of opportunity.

    DataProducts/inc/CRSScintillatorBarIndex.hh
    MCDataProducts/inc/StepPointMC.hh
    CosmicRayShieldGeom/inc/CRSScintillatorBar.hh
    Analyses/src/ReadBack_module.cc

    Moved CRSScintillatorBarIndex from CosmicRayShiledGeom/inc to
    DataProducts/inc.  This was done so that future CRV hit classes can
    use it as a data member.  Also added an extra accessor to StepPointMC.
    The volumeId can now be accessed as a CRSScintillatorBarIndex
    ( as is done for StrawIndex ).

    Changed files that incldue CRSScintillatorBarIndex.hh to get it from the
    new place.

    Also removed some unnecessary includes of CRSScintillatorBarIndex.hh
    from serveral files.

12) March 29, 2012 kutschke
    Mu2eG4/test/transportOnly.fcl
     - Lowered the energy threshold for making strawHits to 0 MeV.
     - Removed a lot of pedagodical comments that are not needed here.
     - Minor reformatting.

11) March 29, 2012 kutschke
    CosmicRayShieldGeom/inc/CosmicRayShield.hh
     - rename an unused method to a cleaner name

10) March 29, 2012 kutschke
    Mu2eG4/src/G4_module.cc
     - Call exportG4PDT on request, at start of job and end of job.
     - Tweak the warnings on multiple runs.  Always warn on the second run.
       Optionally warn on subsequent runs.
     - Use StepInstanceNames instead of the free text strings.

9) March 29, 2012 kutschke
   Mu2eG4/inc/exportG4PDT.hh
   Mu2eG4/src/exportG4PDT.cc
    Print the G4 particle data table.

8) March 29, 2012 kutschke
   MCDataProducts/inc/PDGCode.hh
    Added the enum value:
      G4Threshold = 999999999,

     To test if a PDGCode is G4 defined,
      if ( id > PDGCode::G4Threshold ){
         // This code is defined by G4
      }

   ConditionsService/src/MassCache.cc
     Change this to use the new enum value:

7) March 23, 2012 brownd
    - Keep straw material from inactive hots when the track passes inside
    close to the wire.  This reduces the reco momentum shift to < 5 KeV.
    - Add infrastructure to control hit ambiguity on construction, and add
    an option of using MC true ambiguity with MC-based 'pat rec'.
    - Introduce a symmetric fit function for momentum resolution which
      describes the data much better.

6) March 23, 2012 kutschke
   Added codes for a subset of G4 nuclei to MCDataProducts/inc/PDGCode.hh
   Not all nuclei are present, just those that showed up in a 2 hour run of G4.
   This is the start of a bigger project to add the G4 nuclei and ions to this
   enum and to the Particle data table.

5) March 22, 2012 genser

    Added g4.useNewMuMinusAtomicCapture switch to control the new G4MuonMinusCapture

      Mu2eG4/inc/QGSP_BERT_HP_MU2E00.hh
      Mu2eG4/inc/QGSP_BERT_HP_MU2E00.icc
      Mu2eG4/src/physicsListDecider.cc
      Mu2eG4/src/toggleProcesses.cc
      Mu2eG4/test/geom_mucapture.txt

    Added removing muMinusCaptureAtRest from muons and Decay (if
    present) from muatoms; added G4MuAtomDecay back to GenericMuAtom;
    factored out pname; corrected messages; used verboseLevel
      mucapture/src/G4MuonMinusCapture.cc

    Added MuAtomDecay
      MCDataProducts/inc/ProcessCode.hh

    Other affected files are:
      Mu2eG4/src/PhysicsProcessInfo.cc
      Mu2eG4/test/g4test_mucapture.fcl
      mucapture/src/G4MuAtom.cc
      mucapture/src/G4MuAtomTable.cc
      mucapture/src/G4MuonMinusAtomicCapture.cc

   Mu2eG4/src/G4_module.cc
    - Now it initializes G4 only on the first beginRun call.
    - Previously it did so on every beginRun call, which meant that we
      were limited to one run per job.  We now have a use case that
      requires multiple runs per job.
    - The G4 geometry may not NOT be changed at new runs.  We may allow this some day.
    - On subsequent beginRun calls all other bookkeeping is done.

   To implement the above we needed to tweak:
   Mu2eG4/inc/SteppingAction.hh
   Mu2eG4/src/SteppingAction.cc
     - Split the beginRun method into beginRun and finishConstruction.  The latter
       is only called at the first beginRun.

   Fixed some targets of opportunity:
     Mu2eG4/src/StackingAction.cc
     Mu2eG4/src/generateFieldMap.cc

3) March 20, 2012 brownd

    - Fix error when calculating straw wall material when DOCA is larger than
    the straw radius.  Calculate the electronics propagation time error using
    the POCA instead of time division.  These fixes improve the efficiency of the
    Kalman fit by ~15%, and improve the resolution.  Add diagnostics.
    KalmanTests/KalFit,TrkStrawHit,KalFitMC.
    - Remove vestigal 'calorimeter t0' from StrawHitMC.
      HitMakers/MakeStrawHit_module, MakeDriftCellHit_module

2) March 20, 2012 kutschke
   In the creation of the straw hits, add the correction for the flight time
   from the start of the StepPointMC to POCA.

    HitMakers/src/MakeStrawHit_module.cc

1) March 20, 2012 kutschke
   A new small helper class that will be used in 2), above.
     ConditionsService/inc/MassCache.hh
     ConditionsService/src/MassCache.cc
   In 2), we need, in the middle of a nested loop, to look up information
   in the particle data table. This class implements a caching layer to speed
   up this access.
