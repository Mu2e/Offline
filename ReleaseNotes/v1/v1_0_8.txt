   Temporarily add it to MCDataProducts; remove it once it is available in art.
       MCDataProducts/src/classes.h
       MCDataProducts/src/classes_def.xml

   New data product to hold the status of event mixing.
      MCDataProducts/inc/MixingSummary.hh

   Describe MixingSummary to genreflex

   - Major changes to improve the use of art::Ptr.
   - We now have the tools so that all art::Ptr can be properly initialized as StepPointMC, SimParticle etc are created.
   - We no longer need to get the OrphanHandle<SimParticleCollection> and cast away constness.

   - We can also get rid of the hacks:
       Mu2eG4/src/finalizeSimParticle.cc
       Mu2eG4/src/finalizeStepPointMC.cc
     These were needed because we could not make art::Ptr<SimParticle> until after the SimParticleCollection was
     put into the event.

   - The new technology is that G4_module.cc can ask for the art::ProductID that the SimParticleCollection will get
     upon put.  Once this is known, all objects that construct art::Ptr<SimParticle> may do so immediately.
     G4_module was changed to get this information, distribute it to TrackingAction and to all of the Sensitive Detector
     codes:
       Mu2eG4/src/G4_module.cc

   - Make art::Ptr as needed.
         Mu2eG4/inc/TrackingAction.hh
         Mu2eG4/src/TrackingAction.cc
         Mu2eG4/inc/*SD*.hh
         Mu2eG4/src/*SD*.cc

   - Modify these data products so that the redundant offset is no longer used.  Must, temporarily, keep these
     as data members until a bug fix in genreflex:
        MCDataProducts/inc/SimParticle.hh
        MCDataProducts/inc/StepPointMC.hh
        MCDataProducts/src/StepPointMC.cc

   setup.sh
     - require a newer version of art.
     - The newly deployed G4 no longer defines G4LIBDIR; define it here and do a proper fix later.
