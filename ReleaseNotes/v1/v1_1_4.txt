           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v1_1_4

26) January 10, 2012 youzy
    Add a function to write mu2e G4 geometry into a GDML file.
    The output file can be viewed by a simple macro Mu2eG4/test/mu2e_gdml.C

25) January 8, 2012 kutschke
    EventMixing/src/MixMCEvents_module.cc
     - Remove some hacks that were needed to work around issues in
       older versions of art.

24) January 8, 2012 kutschke
    A bunch of housekeeping changes:
      - Remove unnecessary includes of cassert
      - Comment out some set but unused variables to remove compiler warnings.

23) January 7, 2012 kutschke
    Filters/src/MinimumHits_module.cc
      - Fixed instance name of the extinction monitor StepPointMC collection.

22) January 6, 2012 youzy
    Change Extinction Monitor UCI collimator and shielding shapes.

21) January 6, 2012 ehrlich
    Created the CosmicProductionPlane class (and the associated
    CosmicProductionPlaneMaker) which is put into the map of detector
    elements in GeometryService_service, and is accessible via GeomHandle.
    This class stores the parameters for the plane in which the cosmic
    rays are produced, i.e. the halfwidths of the production plane in x
    and z direction, and the offset in y direction with respect to the
    "cosmic reference point" (see below). This class sets default values
    which can be used for the CosmicToy generator. If the DYB model is
    used instead of the toy model, these values are changed according to
    the entries in the generator's configuration file. The cosmic ray
    generators use these values to produce events.

    The WorldG4Maker calculates the y position of the highest point of the
    detector, i.e. the top of the dirt body + dirt cap. This y coordinate
    and the xz position of the center of the detector system is used as
    "cosmic reference point". The cosmic ray generators produce the events
    in a plane which is centered at (0,y_offset,0). In
    PrimaryGeneratorAction, a coordinate transformation for all generated
    cosmic rays is done, which shifts (0,0,0) to the "cosmic reference
    point".

    The values of the CosmicProductionPlane class and the coordinates of
    the cosmic reference point are used in WorldG4Maker to check whether
    the production plane is within the world volume. If this is not the
    case, it throws an exception.

    Modified Files:
      EventGenerator/src/CosmicDYB.cc
      EventGenerator/src/CosmicToy.cc
      GeometryService/src/GeometryService_service.cc
      GeometryService/src/WorldG4Maker.cc
      Mu2eG4/src/PrimaryGeneratorAction.cc
    Added Files:
      GeometryService/inc/CosmicProductionPlane.hh
      GeometryService/src/CosmicProductionPlane.cc
      GeometryService/src/CosmicProductionPlaneMaker.hh

    Parts of the changes in (20) are obsolete.

20) January 5, 2012 ehrlich
    -Added a function in GeometryService/inc/DetectorSystem.hh to get
     the origin of the detector system.
    -Changed Mu2eG4/src/PrimaryGeneratorAction.cc to position the center
     of the cosmic ray production at the xz origin of the detector system
     and on top of the dirt body (incl. the dirt cap).

19) December 30, 2011 youzy

    For Extinction Monitor UCI Tof, add Sensitive Detector, StepPointMC in Mu2G4
    detector construction, add MC/Reco hits output in MCDataProducts,
    RecoDataProducts, HitMakers , Analyses, Filters and fcl.
    Shapes of Shielding need improvement.

18) December 27, 2011 youzy

    Add Magnets, Tof and Shieldings for ExtMonUCI.

17) December 16, 2011 kutschke
    This is the code that was used to generate the figures for the PAC in Dec 2012.
    It provides a general example on how to select a time slice of the event and
    write out that slice, StrawHits, SimParticles and PointTrajectories.
     Filters/src/HitsInConversionTimeWindow_module.cc

16) December 16, 2011 kutschke
    New code that checks the self consistency of the Ptr objects within a SimParticleColleciton.
      Mu2eUtilities/inc/checkSimParticleCollection.hh
      Mu2eUtilities/src/checkSimParticleCollection.cc

    New code that compresses a SimParticleCollection and a PointTrajectoryCollection.
      Mu2eUtilities/inc/compressPointTrajectoryCollection.hh
      Mu2eUtilities/inc/compressSimParticleCollection.hh


15) December 16, 2011 kutschke
    Tweaks to MinMax.hh so that it follows the same pattern as RMS.hh and SequenceStatistics.hh
    The only code that uses this class is BFieldManagerMaker.cc.
         GeneralUtilities/inc/MinMax.hh
         GeneralUtilities/src/MinMax.cc
         BFieldGeom/src/BFieldManagerMaker.cc

14) December 16, 2011 kutschke
    Add new utilities similar to MinMax.hh
      GeneralUtilities/inc/SequenceStatistics.hh
      GeneralUtilities/inc/RMS.hh
      GeneralUtilities/src/RMS.cc

13) December 15, 2011 gandr

    Implement a list of "killer volumes" to control G4 SteppingAction.
    This generalizes the old "killInHallAir" interface.

12) December 14, 2011 gandr

    Various VirtualDetector clean ups.

    Implemenent new virtual detectors to tune the ExtMonFNAL selection channel.

11) December 12, 2011 gandr

    Implement collimators for ExtMonFNAL.

10) December 8, 2011 genser

   Added TT_Back a Virtual Detector at the Back (downstream) face of the tracker
    MCDataProducts/inc/VirtualDetectorId.hh
    VirtualDetectorGeom/src/VirtualDetector.cc
   Used VirtualDetectorId enum_type and name instead of hard coded constants in
    VirtualDetectorGeom/src/VirtualDetectorMaker.cc
   Used VirtualDetectorId enum_type; added TT_Back VD; used VD names (not
   numbers) for geant4 volume names; minimally restructured code of
    Mu2eG4/src/constructVirtualDetectors.cc
   Explicitly added geant4 visibility attribute parameters in
    Mu2eG4/test/protonBeamDump_v01.txt

9) December 9, 2011 youzy

   Add extinction monitor uci design, directory ExtinctionMonitorUCIGeom created.
   4 collimators with shielding are placed in extmonuci envelope.
   constructExtMonUCI is added in Mu2G4, GeometryService is also updated.

8) December 8, 2011 gandr

   Create concrete walls around the new hall.

7) December 8, 2011 gandr

   The physical hall air has a more complicated shape then G4Box.
   Remove the notion of "hall center" and "half size" from geometry.
   There is still a formal box of hall air, but this is detail
   of the chosen G4 geometry implementation.  Beam dump and ExtMonFNAL
   are contained within the formal "HallAir" box; the area around
   them is filled with dirt (not air!)

   The concrete walls of the hall are missing from the new
   implementation for the moment.

6) December 6, 2011 gandr

   Reduce the amount of volatile information (timestamps, object
   addresses) printed out to make diffing log files easier.

5) December 6, 2011 gandr

   Don't store local offsets in CosmicRayShieldGeom.  It is sufficient
   to know position in mu2e coordinates and parent.centerInMu2e() to
   place a volume.  This change decouples CosmicRayShieldGeom from
   Mu2eBuilding geometry and will let remove the notion of hallCenter
   from the latter.

4) November 23, 2011 gandr

   Implement ProtonBeamDump in geometry and G4.  This affects the hall
   construction (one of the hall walls is now created in
   constructProtonBeamDump). ExtMonFNAL is updated appropriately.

   The extmon secondaries channel is still to be coded, it will be a
   part of the ProtonBeamDump.

   The world size has changed to accommodate the new volumes.
   According to g4test_03 printouts with the transport-only physics
   list, the output from most generators and corresponding hits have
   not changed.  The exception is the cosmicToy generator.

3) November 23, 2011 gandr

   Make dirt behave correctly under world size changes.

2) November 23, 2011 gandr

   SConstruct: don't require SCONS_DIR to be set - it is not useful for the build.

1) November 19, 2011 kutschke
   setup.sh
