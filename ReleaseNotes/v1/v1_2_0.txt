           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v1_2_0

11) July 2, 2012 kutschke
    With geom_01.txt, version 1.154, there were changes to the CRV system which invalidate all data files created before this change.
    If you use code from after this change to read files created before this change, you will get nonsensical results and there will
    be some program crashed due to out of bounds container indices.

    We still need to use the mix-in-background files that were created before this change.  To make this work I made new versions
    of the background files with the crv hits dropped.  I updated the mixing example to use the new files.

    EventMixing/test/mixExample01.fcl

    I also updated

      fcl/standardProducers.fcl

    so that it will not try to mix crv hits.

    I also updated

      Analyses/src/ReadBack_module.cc

    so that it will skip the CRV section if the CRV hits are absent.

    Added preliminary version of crosstalk StrawHits (disabled by default)
    Added simple TrackerCalibrations: EnergyToAmplitude, AmplitudeToEnergy, CrossTalk
    Prepared for hit energy to amplitude conversion; added diagnostic printout

     ConditionsService/src/TrackerCalibrations.cc
     ConditionsService/inc/TrackerCalibrations.hh
     EventMixing/test/mixExample01.fcl
     HitMakers/src/MakeStrawHit_module.cc
     HitMakers/src/ReadStrawHit_module.cc

   Implement a source module for reading ExtMonFNAL MARS inputs.

   These files have never been tested since the changeover from cms-lite to art.
   Lots of debugging to get them to work.  This uncovered a problem with the random number
   service.
     Mu2eG4/test/drop03.fcl
     Mu2eG4/test/replayAll.fcl

   Add PS Vacuum as sensitive detector to record tracks in PS.
   This sensitive volume is off (default), turn on with
   bool PS.Vacuum.Sensitive = true;

   - M MCDataProducts/inc/StepInstanceName.hh
   - M Mu2eG4/inc/SensitiveDetectorName.hh
   - M Mu2eG4/src/Mu2eWorld.cc
   - M Mu2eG4/src/constructPS.cc
   - M Mu2eG4/test/ProductionSolenoid_v01.txt

   A module is added to read steps in PS Vacuum and create ntuples.

   - Analyses/src/ReadPSVacuum_module.cc
   - Analyses/test/psVacuum_readback.fcl

   Few changes, made for the simulation of trapped particles. Don't affect
   other studies.

   - Analyses/src/ReadVirtualDetector_module.cc

   New module option "addProperTime" (default: false). If true, the proper
   time, saved in the particles ntuple, is calculated as the sum proper
   time of similar particles in the decay chain. This is needed for studies,
   when pion decay is switched off.

   Small bug fixed: "isvd" is the particles ntuples is now declared as
   bool, not float.

   - Mu2eG4/src/StackingAction.cc
   - Mu2eG4/inc/StackingAction.hh

   New geometry parameter g4.minPitch (default: 0), handled by StackingAction.
   It allows to drop all particles with sin(Theta) (pt/p) less than
   specified value. This cut is useful for simulation of trapped particles.

   - Mu2eG4/test/makeGeneratorFile.py

   This utility, which generated input file for the event generator from the
   data, saved in the vitrual detectors trees, was completely rewritten, and
   it now gets data from particles tree (ntpart), rather than from virtual
   detectors ntuple (ntvd).

   Mu2eG4/src/exportG4PDT.cc
     - Formatting changes

   Mu2eG4/src/G4_module.cc
     - Follow-on from above.

4) June 19, 2012 gandr

   Tweak ExtMonFNAL filter channel definition to reduce acceptance loss due to multiple scattering.

3) June 15, 2012 gandr

   Make sure the overhead dirt above ExtMonFNAL does not end abruptly
   at the edge of the ceiling.

2) June 14, 2012 brownd
  Change default configuration of TrkPatRec to apply improved hit ambiguity
  resolution algorithm and simulated annealing.
  Change default time division resolution to correspond to recent
  measurements, see conditions_01.txt for details.

1) June 14, 2012 gandr

   Introduce a new geometry class Mu2eEnvelope.  Simplify WorldG4Maker.
