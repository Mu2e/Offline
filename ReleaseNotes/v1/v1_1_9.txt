           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v1_1_9

37) June 12, 2012 kutschke
    Filters/src/MinimumHits_module.cc
      - Add a mode capability so that it can do different sorts of selections.

    New files added to support this:
      MCDataProducts/inc/StepFilterMode.hh
      MCDataProducts/src/StepFilterMode.cc

    Updated to know about StepFilterMode
      MCDataProducts/src/classes.h
      MCDataProducts/src/classes_def.xml

    Mu2eG4/test/geom_01_LowDetailGraphics.txt
      This file is only used by code that does example graphics
      and does not write event-data output files.  So speed it up
      by choosing QGSP_BERT ( not HP ) as the physics model.

35) June 12, 2012 kutschke
    Added an example of viewing the provenance information that is
    attached to each data product.  This works properly when
    viewing products created within a job but fails when viewing
    products read from and event-data file.  Examples of both
    are provided.  A bug report has been filed with art.

      Analyses/test/viewProvenanceBug.fcl

    GeneralUtilities/inc/OwningPointerCollection.hh
      - It was not possible to write an art::Ptr that pointed to
        and object in one of these collections.
      - The reason was that the class template was missing some
        of the features required by Ptr.
      - The required changes were
         a) Add some typedefs
         b) Add begin() and end() methods.
         c) Change the return types of operator[](size_t)
            and the method at(size_t) from T const& to T const*.
      - I have not yet checked that art::Assns works.

    I also had to change the following files to repair the change in the
    return type:
      EventDisplay/src/DataInterface.cc
      EventDisplay/src/EventDisplay_module.cc
      KalmanTests/src/ReadKalFits_module.cc
      Sandbox/src/ReadTracerProductCollection_module.cc

    If you have code that reads back the Kalman filtered tracks from the
    event, then you need to make the following change to it.  Also you should
    do a clean build or, if you know how, remove the dictionaries from
    KalmanTests and Sandbox before rebuilding.

    Consider the code fragment below:

    art::Handle<TrkRecoTrkCollection> trksHandle;
    evt.getByLabel(_fitterModuleLabel,trksHandle);
    TrkRecoTrkCollection const& trks = *trksHandle;

    for ( size_t i=0; i< trks.size(); ++i ){
        TrkRecoTrk const& trk = trks[i];
        // and so on
    }

    The line inside the for loop should be changed to the following.

        TrkRecoTrk const& trk = *trks[i];

    The difference is the * to dereference the new return type:

    Mu2eG4/src/G4_module.cc
       More refactoring and removal of stale comments.
       Ten of the 11 StepPointMCCollections have a lot of repeated code.
       This code was moved into loops that live inside a new class,
       SensitiveDetectorHelper.
       The 11th collection, for time virtual detectors does not use the
       G4 sensitive detector mechanism.  Instead it is dealt with inside
       the user stepping action code.  It was left unchanged.

    MCDataProducts/inc/StepInstanceName.hh
    MCDataProducts/src/StepInstanceName.cc
       Added the allValues method, needed by the new code in G4_module.cc

    New files:
      Mu2eG4/inc/SensitiveDetectorHelper.hh
      Mu2eG4/src/SensitiveDetectorHelper.cc

32) June 8, 2012 kutschke
    In preparation for a future change, the name of the sensitive detectors
    to match the StepInstanceName.  Note that all tracks now have the
    sensitive detector name "tracker", even the ITracker.  This is OK since
    any job contains exactly one sensitive detector object for a tracker;
    it never contains more than 1.

      Mu2eG4/src/constructTTrackerv3.cc

31) June 8, 2012 kutschke
    setup_g4951.sh
      - Previously this failed if it was used on a system on which artexternals
        contained only the products needed for art v1_00_11.
      - I simplified to be an exact copy of setup.sh but with the version
        numbers changed and the few additions.
      - The intention is that this file is a hack that will go away as soon
        as the default setup moves to art v1_00_11 - so there are no
        long term maintenance issues.

30) June 6, 2012 ehrlich
    updated the active and passive cosmic ray shields
    and the geometry of the detector hall
    updated files:

        Mu2eG4/test/geom_01.txt


29) June 6, 2012 gandr

    - Merge PS and PSE vacua into a single volume.  Introduce new
      geometry class PSVacuum to support this.  This change is a
      pre-requisite for the HRS move.

    - Move the heat and radiation shield to agree with MARS and
      G4Beamline positions.

28) Jun 5, 2012 genser

    Added infrastructure to have absorber layers in coll5; Added
    virtual detector Coll5_OutSurf; Also, used Tube object to make
    coll5; added verbosityLevel controlled printout; changed pointer to
    _config to ref

27) June 5, 2012 tassiell
    Removed from the cvs the following files:
      ITrackerGeom/ITrackerGeom_2fr_hlfSL.gdml
      ITrackerGeom/ITrackerGeom.gdml
      ITrackerGeom/ITrackerWireData.root
    They contained an old description of ITracker geometry,
    and they are no more used.

26) June 4, 2012 tassiell
    Reintroduced switch for the MSC model for e-, needed by the ITracker,
    only for the geant4 version less than 4.9.5
    (this fix the problem at point 22).
    The switch is done into the method checkMSCmodel.
    Mu2eG4/src/SConscript
      Added G4VERSION variable that can be used by preprocessors statements
      to know the running geant4 version number.

25) June 4, 2012 tassiell
    Update of the classes ITGasLayerSDs to be derived classes
    from Mu2eSensitiveDetector.
    Changes into files:
    Mu2eG4/inc/ITGasLayerSD.hh
    Mu2eG4/inc/ITGasLayerSD_Square.hh
    Mu2eG4/inc/ITGasLayerSD_Hexagonal.hh
    Mu2eG4/src/ITGasLayerSD.cc
    Mu2eG4/src/ITGasLayerSD_Square.cc
    Mu2eG4/src/ITGasLayerSD_Hexagonal.cc

24) Jun 4, 2012 kutschke
    Mu2eG4/src/G4module.cc
      More refactoring.  Created a new free function to act as a steering
      routine for the all of the G4 customization that takes place after the
      call to G4RunManager::Initialize.  Deleted stale, misleading comments.

    Mu2eG4/inc/postG4InitializeTasks.hh
    Mu2eG4/src/postG4InitializeTasks.cc
      This is the new routine.

    Mu2eG4/inc/setMinimumRangeCut.hh
    Mu2eG4/src/setMinimumRangeCut.cc
      Moved the old G4::setOtherCuts method into this free function.
      It is called from postG4InitializeTasks.

23) Jun 3, 2012 kutschke
    Mu2eG4/src/G4module.cc
      Refactoring only.  In the code that calls the beginG4Event of each
      sensitive detector object, it is only necessary to up cast to
      Mu2eSensitiveDetector, not to the concrete classes.  Make that change.
      Also, the c'tor has become very, very big; move it out of the header
      just to make the header easier to read.

22) Jun 3, 2012 kutschke
    Mu2eG4/src/G4module.cc
      Removed changes in introduced at revision 1.44. These are the
      changes that Gianfrano made to allow a switch to a different EM model.
      The problem was the requested model is not present in G4 v4.9.5.1;
      this caused compilation errors when we tried to compile with the
      more recent G4 version.

5) May 4, 2012 kutschke
   In SConstruct, remove FigureOfMerit from the build when the splines
   package is not present.  This is a temporary hack until the splines
   package is more routinely available.

4) May 3, 2012 gandr

   Correct the placement of the production target.  The bug caused
   protons from the PrimaryProtonGun to miss the prodution target.

3) April 27, 2012 gandr

   Implement windows in the PS enclusure end plate.

2) April 27, 2012 kutschke
   Add checks to GeometryService so that it will throw if we try to load
   a geometry in which two calorimeters are defined.

1) April 27, 2012 gandr

   Install PS heat and radiation shield.
