   FPG reads position and time of the stopped muons from an input file
   located in
   grid/fermiapp/mu2e/DataFiles/ExampleDataFiles/StoppedMuons/stoppedMuons_02.txt
   Another option has been included: one can add in the generation time of the particle
   the proton spill time. The default option is to read from the input file.
   In this case the proton spill time delay is already included.

   setup.sh
     FHICL_FILE_PATH now set to absolute, not relative paths.
     This allows Offline to be used as a proper base release.

   bin/addlocal.sh
     Test release directories added to the front of FHICL_FILE_PATH.
     This uses absolute paths.

   The _readouts data member of RecoDataProducts/inc/CaloCrystalHit.hh
   was not correctly initialized.  It's key contained the Id of the CaloHit,
   not the position of the CaloHit in the CaloHitCollection; this is fixed.
     HitMakers/src/MakeCaloCrystalHits_module.cc

   Provide an additional functor to help with the above fix.
     Mu2eUtilities/inc/sort_functors.hh

   The only code to use this data member had a work around to fix the
   problem.  The work around is now removed:
