           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v1_1_0

29) October 13, 2011 kutschke
    Replace checkout.csh with checkout.sh
    The csh version was not playing nice with the login scripts on some
    machines.  The .sh version should be either sourceable or executable.

    Some weeks ago Dave Brown updated the BaBar classes in the lbl repository.
    He did not make the changes to the Dch* libraries ( because it would be a lot
    of work and these are only needed for the ITracker ).  We informed Fedor who
    will make the changes when he starts again to work on the ITracker.

    Today I removed the following 4 link libraries from 3 SConscript files.

    The removed link libraries are:
     'BaBar_DchData',     'BaBar_DchGeom', 'BaBar_DchGeomBase', 'BaBar_DchCalib',

    They were removed from:
       EventDisplay/src/SConscript
       KalmanTests/src/SConscript
       TrkPatRec/src/SConscript

    This was needed because the builds for EventDisplay, KalmanTests and TrkPatRec failed
    when they could not find the no-longer-built libraries.

    Many changes related to event mixing.  This should be the first properly functioning
    mixing code.  It will compile with art v0_7_13 but it requires v0_7_16 or higher
    to work properly; there is a run-time test in the code to stop if an incorrect
    version is used.

    This version has the first working version of the MixingSummary object; the previous
    version was just a place holder.  There is also a new module to compute the overall
    G4 status of the mixed event.  This required some updates to the StatusG4 class.

    I have created an enum matched to string class to hold the allowed values of the instance
    names of the StepPointMC collections.  I will migrate this through the rest of the code.

    New files:
      MCDataProducts/inc/StepInstanceName.hh
      MCDataProducts/src/StepInstanceName.cc
      MCDataProducts/src/MixingSummary.cc
      EventMixing/src/SummarizeStatusG4_module.cc

    Modified files:

      EventMixing/test/mixTest_00.fcl
      EventMixing/src/MixMCEvents_module.cc
      EventMixing/src/MixAnalyzer_module.cc
      MCDataProducts/inc/StatusG4.hh
      MCDataProducts/src/StatusG4.cc
      MCDataProducts/inc/MixingSummary.hh

    some updates on the module FastPatternReco that was previously (from July 11, 2011) inserted,
    at this time it contains a fast event filter for the TTracker.
    Moreover the following data containers had been added:
      MCDataProducts/inc/GenElHitData.hh
      MCDataProducts/inc/VisibleGenElTrack.hh
      MCDataProducts/inc/VisibleGenElTrackCollection.hh
      RecoDataProducts/inc/TrackerHitTimeCluster.hh
      RecoDataProducts/inc/TrackerHitTimeClusterCollection.hh
      RecoDataProducts/inc/SectorStationCluster.hh
      RecoDataProducts/inc/SctrSttnClusterGroup.hh
      RecoDataProducts/inc/SctrSttnClusterGroupCollection.hh

    The density of the vaccum has been corrected (the previous value,
    hard-written in the code, wasn't precise). Got rid of some compiler
    warnings in
    Mu2eG4/src/ConstructMaterial.cc
    Analyses/src/BkgNorm_module.cc

24) October 4, 2011 kutschke
    Analyses/src/ReadBack_module.cc
    Bug fixes and expanded printout for CaloHitMCCrystalPtr,
    CaloHitMCReadoutPtr, and caloCrystalOnlyHits.  Previously none of
    the intended printout for these objects was printed.

23) October 3, 2011 kutschke
    HitMakers/src/MakeCaloReadoutHits_module.cc
    Major rewrite to look for multiple StepPointMCCollections
    within one event; this will happen in events with multiple
    background streams mixed in.

22) September 29, 2011 gandr
    Mu2eG4: proper const-ness of rotation for the nestXXX() family of functions.

21) September 29, 2011 kutschke
    Mu2eUtilities/inc/ConfigFileLookupPolicy
     An upcoming change to cetlib requires that this d'tor
     be declared noexcept.  It is safe to make the change
     now so I have.

20) September 25, 2011 kutschke
    Add a module for testing FHICL.
    Offline/Sandbox/src/FHICLTest00_module.cc
    Offline/Sandbox/test/fhciltest00.fcl

19) September 25, 2011 kutschke
    Lots of work on event mixing.  All of GenParticles, SimParticles,
    StepPointMCs and PointTrajectories are now correct.  The G4Status
    objects are not yet done properly.
      EventMixing/src/MixMCEvents_module.cc

    New code to test whether mixing was done correctly:
      EventMixing/src/InspectDataProducts_module.cc
      EventMixing/test/inspectMixed.fcl  
      EventMixing/test/inspectUnMixed.fcl

    New modifier needed for mixing ( modifier for simId() )
      MCDataProducts/inc/PointTrajectory.hh

18) September 21, 2011 onoratog
    Some commented lines erased from geom_01.txt.
    The stopped muons input file to be read by generators who use FPG now is unique.
    In the config file the syntax is now:
    string FoilParticleGenerator.STfilename = "FileName"
    instead of 
    string conversionGun.STfilename = "complete path of the file"
    and 
    string EjectedProtonGun.STfilename = "complete path of the file"
    and so on.

17) September 19, 2011 ehrlich
    EventDisplay
    -Events can now be stored in different image file formats (ps, png, gif, ...).
    -Animated events can now be stored in Root TTrees.

16) September 19, 2011 kutschke
    Added endJob printout to Filters/src/MinimumHits_module.cc

15) September 18, 2011 kutschke
    Removed maybe_ref.hh from Mu2eUtilties. Now use the version from cetlib.
    This triggered changes to a few other include files.

14) September 15, 2011 ehrlich
    EventDisplay
    -Changed the view options. Now, the side view and end view keep the aspect ratio.

13) September 12, 2011 ehrlich
    EventDisplay:
    -The analyze method of the module cds back to the original gPad and gDirectory after each event.
    -If the Quit button is pressed, an exception is thrown so that one doesn't have to wait for the remaining events to be processed.

12.5) September 9, 2011 brownd
    TrkPatRec:
    -Moved TrkPatRec from private code into Offline.  This code performs
    pattern recognition for conversion electrons in the TTracker.


12) September 7, 2011 ehrlich
    EventDisplay:
    -Added an option to draw the graph of the Kalman residuals.

11) September 3, 2011 ehrlich
    EventDisplay:
    -Added the option of saving the event display content into a Root file.
    -Added keyboard commands to move and rotatate the event display content.

10) August 26, 2011 onoratog
    New vacuum added, still not in use as default, made by N2 at 10e-4 Torr

9) August 26, 2011 onoratog
   The input file for stopped muons at the ST can be changed now at run time
   as a configuration parameter.
   The file used at the moment is still the default one. If one want to change
   it, he has to add this line in the genconfig file

   string conversionGun.STfilename = "complete path of the file"
   (for the conversion gun)
   and similar for the other generators that use this file.
 
8) August 25, 2011 onoratog
   A new background generator has been added. It is EjectedPhotonGun, and it
   simulates the photon coming out from Aluminum foils after nuclear muon
   capture. The configuration file 
   Mu2eG4/test/genconfig_05.txt
   has been modified to include configuration parameters for this new
   background gun. The syntax is identical to the ejectedProton(Neutron).

7) August 23, 2011 kutschke
   Added an enum for the virtual detectors.  Used the model of GenId and 
   ProcessId so that << prints out both the number and a name.
    MCDataProducts/inc/VirtualDetectorId.hh 
    MCDataProducts/src/VirtualDetectorId.cc       

6) August 22, 2011, genser
      Added a timing printout for use with the fast profiling tools
     Mu2eG4/src/Mu2eG4RunManager.cc

5) August 14, 2011 ehrlich
   Updated track colors in EventDisplay

4) August 14, 2011 vbiliyar
   Modified EventGenerator/src/EjectedNeutronGun.cc and
   EventGenerator/inc/EjectedNeutronGun.hh to enable switching between
   different models of neutron spectra. Added the neutron spectrum model 
   from doc-db 1619.
   
3) August 7, 2011 ehrlich
   Updated Kalman Tracks/Hits in EventDisplay

2) August 4, 2011 genser

   Changed offset calculations to (re?)enable movements of the mu2e
   coordinate system within the G4 world volume in preparation for the
   world volume extension to accommodate more components
   Changed the arguments to add more reference frame flexibility; used
   mu2e reference frame for offset calculations; added diagnostic
   printout:
     Mu2eG4/inc/constructDummyStoppingTarget.hh
     Mu2eG4/inc/constructStoppingTarget.hh
     Mu2eG4/src/constructDummyStoppingTarget.cc
     Mu2eG4/src/constructProtonAbsorber.cc
     Mu2eG4/src/constructStoppingTarget.cc
     Mu2eG4/src/constructVirtualDetectors.cc
   As above, plus added verbosity level config file dependence:
     Mu2eG4/src/Mu2eWorld.cc
   Added a verbosity argument for G4 world construction; added comments
     Mu2eG4/test/geom_01.txt

1) August 3, 2011 fischler

   1. Moduified Mu2eG4/test/ttracker_v2.txt, which adjusts the geometry 
      specification for the TTracker, to correct the Z-spacing discrepancy
      noted in DocDB #1744.  The spacing nopw matches that of the TTracker
      chapter in the CDR, DocDB #1342.
