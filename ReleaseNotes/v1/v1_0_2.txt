           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v1_0_2


5) June 1, 2011 kutschke
   Revert part of item 3.  We need to keep the declaration of
   cet::map_vector_key until the next version of art.
        DataProducts/src/classes_def.xml

4) June 1, 2011 mf
   TrackerGeom/inc/StrawIndex.hh
     - Add a representation of an undefined value.

   Add more detailed accessors for nearest neighbours of a straw.
   This is only defined for straws in a sector with two layers.
      TrackerGeom/inc/Straw.hh
      TrackerGeom/src/Straw.cc
      TTrackerGeom/inc/TTrackerMaker.hh
      TTrackerGeom/src/TTrackerMaker.cc

3) June 1, 2011 greenc
   Remove declarations of types that are already known to art.
     DataProducts/src/classes.h  
     DataProducts/src/classes_def.xml  

2) June 1, 2011 greenc
   Remove TObjectness of classes in 
     ITrackerGeom/inc/ITrackerWiredata.hh

   Remove unnecessary lines from:
     ITrackerGeom/src/classes.h

1) Many of the .fcl and SConscript files were converted to use art before 
   working code was available to test them.  So some have small issues
   that we are fixing on the fly as they are discovered and we are not
   documenting these in detail.
