   Analyses/src/StoppingTarget00_module.cc
    - Write to an output file the stopping points and
      times of muons that stop in the target.
    - Tweak histograms and comment out diagnostic printout

   KalmanTests/inc/TrkRecoTrkCollection.hh
   KalmanTests/src/KalFitTest_module.cc
      Use 4) to add TrkRecoTrk to the event.

   KalmanTests/src/ReadKalFits_module.cc
   KalmanTests/test/KalFit01.fcl
      New module to show how to read TrkRecoTrk from the event.
      Update .fcl file to use the new module

5) June 10, 2011 kutschke
   Add new tests in Sandbox to debug 4).

4) June 10, 2011 kutschke
   A new class template to allow us to add (transient only)
   objects on the heap to an event:
    GeneralUtilities/inc/OwningPointerCollection.hh

   added new StrawCluster (cluster of straws within a panel) class to 
   RecoDataProducts. 
   Each cluster is a vector of pointers to the StraHits that fired. 
   The StrawCluster class only contains the elements that we want to 
   are persistent.
   To access derived quantities I have added   StrawClusterUtilities to 
   Mu2eUtilities. This class provides information about the cluster 
   like position, where in the detector, deposited total energy, a 
   line segment representing the cluster etc. 
   Finally ReadStrawCluster_module in HitMakers demonstrates the use of this 
   classes.

   Corrected placement of Proton Absorber to properly account for the
   presence of virtual detectors
     Mu2eG4/src/constructProtonAbsorber.cc
   Implemented a more thorough overlap check 
     Mu2eG4/src/constructVirtualDetectors.cc

   Added virtual detectors 13 and 14 in front of the ttracker; 
     Mu2eG4/src/constructVirtualDetectors.cc
     VirtualDetectorGeom/src/VirtualDetectorMaker.cc
   Corrected for the protonabs2 parent volume being a boolean solid;
   added verbosityLevel and diagnostic printout; made some variable
   names more mnemonic; changed color of protonabs2 to be more
   distinguishable from VD
     Mu2eG4/src/constructProtonAbsorber.cc
   Added protonabsorber and vd verbosityLevel
     Mu2eG4/test/geom_01.txt
   Changed type of the mother parameter from G4LogicalVolume* to
   VolumeInfo const& in constructTTrackerv3 to force offset
   calculations
     Mu2eG4/inc/constructTTracker.hh
     Mu2eG4/src/Mu2eWorld.cc
   Also changed/enhanced diagnostic printout
     Mu2eG4/src/constructTTrackerv3.cc
   Added some protection against wrong ds3 parameters; added
   diagnostic printout related to the boolean volume construction
     Mu2eG4/src/constructDS.cc
   Added "vis" file to print volume hierarchy
     Mu2eG4/test/visTree.mac
   Added commented out visMacro lines
     Mu2eG4/test/transportOnly.fcl
