   - The type of cet::map_vector_key will be changed to unsigned from int.
         - This is the type of trackIds of SimParticles.
     - The eventdisplay code that printed these trackIds choked because expandLine had an overload for
       double and one for int but none for unsigned.  The compiler could not decide which overload to use.
     - We changed the second overload to a template so it now works for both signed and unsigned integral types.
     - There is now a new issue to be resolved later:
         If you call explandLine with a float it will take the second overload and bypass the formatting that
         is clearly planned for the overload that takes a double.

    EventDisplay/src/EventDisplay_module.cc
     - This code help the pset object by const&.  Since the creation of art, psets disappear soon after the c'tor is called.
       So we must hold copies by value.  We should prefer, in the c'tor, to extract information from the pset and cache the
       extracted information ( again holding by value, not by pointer or ref ).
     - I believe that this worked correctly pre-art.

       Many updates to KalmanTests.  Mostly refactoring.

    June 23-27, 2011 tassiell
       New package FastPatternReco plus new RecoDataProducts.
       These are

   Replaced char[] with stringstream in EventDisplay/srs/dict_classes/ComponentInfo.h.

   FoilParticleGenerator now take into account also particles whose generation time
   is beyond the 1694 ns of the microbunch. It includes 3 cycles after the nominal one,
   subtracting the 1964 to the original generation time, in order to simulate
   the effects of the particles whose primary proton comes from the previous microbunch.

2) June 23, 2011 logash

   Changed default thickness of pbar absorber to 360 mkm (geom_01.txt)

   Updated ReadVirtualDetector_plugin.cc:
    - allowed for up to 20 virtual detectors
    - added option saveStopped to save in the particles ntuple 
      only stopped particles
    - added option requireVD to save in the particles ntuple 
      only those particles, which cross particular virtual detector
