           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v7_1_4

3) edmonds 5 October 2018
  - add a module that separates out the "calorimeter" and "calorimeterRO" CaloShowerSteps (representing crystal and SiPM steps) out of the compression, which had combined them (Filters/src/SeparatesCaloShowerSteps_module.cc)
  - add a module that checks this separation by plotting histograms of the z-position of the steps (Filters/src/SeparatesCaloShowerStepsCheck_module.cc)
  - this is for DS-cosmic-mixing, which doesn't run the primary generation inline and so runs on the DS-cosmic primary dataset itself
  - the separated collections are not kept so that all datasets have the same output, if you run into a problem that needs the CaloShowerSteps separating, then use the new modules
