           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v7_3_3, under development

2) 2/18/19 rlc
   Change all TTracker to Tracker.  A user is most likely
   to be disrupted if they use personal geometry files that contain
   "ttracker" - these can be updated with:
   sed -i 's/ttracker/tracker/g' *.txt
   Also the names of geometry volumes change from "TTracker*"
   to "Tracker*".

1) 2/11/19 rlc
   clean up and re-organize several things in preparation
   for database-based alignment.  remove Alignment directory.
   Create GeneralUtilities HepTransform to hold alignments.
