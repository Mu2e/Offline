           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v3_0_0

4) March 19, 2013 kutschke
   Completed the migration of the last few SConscript files:
     - TrkPatRecI/src/SConscript
     - TrkPatRecI/miniilc/src/SConscript
   This is ready to start general testing.

   The svn version is now used explicitly in the setup BaBar.

   Sometime in the past versions of art, there was a change made in the regexp used by art to
   match a module name, given by module_type, to the list of all _module.so in LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
   To work around this we introduced a long planned upgrade to the build system. We also wrote a
   python helper class to assist in forming the names and doing much of the repeated work.
   The net result is that the SConscript files are now much cleaner.  A few SConscript files don't
   quite follow the pattern and they are written in a mix of the old and new style.
   The new class is defined in the SConstruct file.  All 76 of the SConscript files also changed.

   Migration from v1_00_08 to art v1_03_08
   - Update setup.sh to choose the correct product versions
   - Used scripts from art/tools/migration:
       - /update_sources.sh --no-fix-pset <mu2e-source-topdir>
       - <path-to-tools/migration>/fix-auto-ptr
       - <path-to-tools/migration>/fix-service-macros.pl
       - fix-services.pl
       - fix-signals.pl
   - Included in the above:
        - Change std::auto_ptr to std::unique_ptr everywhere
        - Add a new macro to the end of _service.hh files
        - New syntax for registering the response to signals in services
   - Add std::move to calls to put products into an event.
   - std::unique_ptr<T> objects that are initialized to zero must use (nullptr) not (0).
   - Add move c'tor and move assignment to GeneralUtilties/inc/OwningPointerCollection.
       - For reasons that are not understood, genreflex now insists that we have a copy c'tor and
         copy assignment.  So I added these methods - they will throw an exception if they are ever
         called.  This is a hack and the problem should be fixed properly.
       - Very likely this class can be replaced by std::vector<std::unique_ptr<T> >.
   - In RecoDataProducts/inc/StrawHitPosition.hh add #ifndef __GCCXML__ lines to exclude code that
     chokes genreflex.  A proper solution will be to move a lot of the functionality into facade classes.
