           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v2_1_1

6) January 19, 2013 kutschke
   Analyses/src/ReadBack_module.cc
   Add histograms to monitor PointTrajectoryCollection.

5) January 18, 2013 kutschke
   Mu2eG4/src/Mu2eG4UserHelpers.cc
    In the function controlTrajectorySaving, there was a logic error.
    Now fixed.

   TTrackerGeom/src/TTrackerMaker.cc
    - Filter out StepPointMCs that have a POCA that is outside of the active length of the wire.
    - The default active length of the wire is defined as follows: find the segment of
      the wire that is fully outside of the support rings - then the outermost 10 mm is
      not active.

   Mu2eG4/test/ttracker_v3.txt
     The geometry description of the TTracker with:
        - Support structure modelled as in Mu2e-doc-888-v5
        - Metal layers on straws and gold plating on wires

   To use this version do one of:
     a) edit geom_01.txt, comment out #include ttracker_v2.txt and replace it with
        and include of ttracker_v3.txt
     b) Make a new geometry file with two lines
        #include "Mu2eG4/test/geom_01.txt"
        #include "Mu2eG4/test/ttracker_v3.txt"

   There remains one todo item: the staves are solid Al; that is, the cutout for the services
   has not been implemented.

2) January 6, 2013 kutschke
   Added two major options to the TTracker.
     - A detailed model of the support structure, following Mu2e-doc-888
     - A detailed model of the metal coatings on the straws and sense wires.
   For the momment these can be turned on and off together, but not one at a time.
   The choice is made with the following paramameter in the geometry file:

  int ttrackerSupport.model = "simple";      // Old, simpler model - default.
  int ttrackerSupport.model = "detailedv0";  // New, detailed model.

  The main changes and additions to the GeometryService classes are:

  TTrackerGeom/inc/TTracker.hh
  TTrackerGeom/src/TTracker.cc
  TTrackerGeom/inc/TTrackerMaker.hh
  TTrackerGeom/src/TTrackerMaker.cc
  TrackerGeom/inc/StrawDetail.hh
  TrackerGeom/src/StrawDetail.cc
  GeomPrimitives/inc/TubsParams.hh
  GeomPrimitives/inc/PlacedTubs.hh     - New
  GeomPrimitives/src/PlacedTubs.cc     - New
  TTrackerGeom/inc/SupportModel.hh     - New
  TTrackerGeom/inc/SupportStructure.hh - New
  TTrackerGeom/src/SupportModel.cc     - New
  TTrackerGeom/src/SupportStructure.cc - New

   - Added objects to hold the new support structure and the details of the straws.
   - The TTracker object has the information to build the G4 model of either the old or the new style.
   - Renamed some accessors and variable names that might be confusing with the new that had names that had become
     misleading after the above changes.
   - Also changed wire positions and directions to match CDR values.

  The code that constructs the G4 geometry has also been updated:

  Mu2eG4/inc/constructTTracker.hh
  Mu2eG4/src/constructTTrackerv3.cc
  Mu2eG4/src/constructTTrackerv3Detailed.cc

  The file constructTTrackerv3.cc is mostly unchanged - it just checks for which model is selected and
  forwards to the work to constructTTrackerv3Detailed.cc, if called for.

  The sensitive detector code also needd changing:
  Mu2eG4/inc/StrawSD.hh
  Mu2eG4/src/StrawSD.cc

  The last change is:

  Mu2eG4/test/ttracker_v0.txt

  which defines ttracker.sectorPhi0 which is now a required parameter.


1) January 6, 2013 kutschke
   GeneralUtilities/inc/EnumToStringSparse.hh
   Class template for enum-matched-to-string classes.
   We will eventually switch all enum-matched-string-classes to use this template or a similar one.
   First use is in: TTrackerGeom/inc/SupportModel.hh
