        hold output files.

38) August 9, 2012 kutschke
    All printout from the GeometryService, the objects that it creates
    and from the G4 construct* routines, is now under verbosity control.
    All exisiting verbosity switches in for these codes have been set to 0
    ( ie to minimal printout ).
    Cleaned up a few targets of opportunity in the process.

37) August 9, 2012 youzy
    add Extinction Monitor UCI Internal Map in geom_01.txt

35) August 6, 2012 kutschke
    There was a bug in the record keeping section of SimpleConfig that
    was added in item 28.  The access counts were incremented when the
    print method was called.  This has been fixed.
       ConfigTools/src/SimpleConfigRecord.cc
       ConfigTools/src/SimpleConfigRecord.hh

34) August 3, 2012 brownd
    Extended TrkPatRec so that it can perform searches for different particles
    species and different propagation directions.

30) July 30, 2012 gandr

    EventGenerators: New parameter extMonFNALGun.reference allows to
    select between starting simulation at the filter entrance or the
    detector.

29) July 27, brownd
    Add particle and direction-specific tags to tracks found by TrkPatRec.
    Create standardProducer configurations for finding common configurations
    (downstream e-, upstream e+, ...) so those can be invoked by name in a user
    job.

28) July 27, kutschke
    Committed a lot of new features to SimpleConfig. There are now lots of
    methods to print usage statistics.  There is also a way to print an informational
    message when a parameter is not found and a user supplied default value is use.

    There is now a detailed writeup on SimpleConfig:
      http://mu2e.fnal.gov/atwork/computing/SimpleConfig.shtml

    There are 3 services and two modules that use SimpleConfig. They now all have
    parameter set parameters to enable/disable many sorts of diagnostic printout from
    SimpleConfig; the default is to only print error messages.  This affects:
      ConditionsService/src/ConditionsService_service.cc
      ConditionsService/src/GlobalConstantsService_service.cc
      GeometryService/src/GeometryService_service.cc
      EventGenerator/src/EventGenerator_module.cc
      EventGenerator/src/G4BeamlineGenerator_module.cc

    Some of the old SimpleConfig input files, such as geom_01.txt had parameters:
      bool printConfig = false;
      bool printConfigStats = false;

    The corresponding services and modules no longer look for these parameters ( they use
    their parameter set parameters ) so these have been removed.


27) July 26, kutschke
    Moved safesqrt and sqrtOrThrow from Mu2eUtilities to GeneralUtilties.
    This was done so that they may be used in data products.  I also change the
    exception thrown by sqrtOrThrow from a cet::exception to a stdexcept exception.
    This was done because the code in GeneralUtilties should not depend on cetlib.

    Also changed the #include statements throughout the code to find the new include files.

26) July 25, kutschke
    Add the *merge.fcl files to EventMixing/inputGeneration/ .

25) July 24, kutschke
    Added 3 services to Sandbox and three assoicated test modules and .fcl
    files: FooService, BarService and XBarService.  These are used to explore
    illustrate the order of operations when two services depend on each other.

24) July 23, brownd
    Remove several obsolete BaBar classes from the data heirarchy used by
    mu2e.  This simplifies the code and facilitates several planned upgrades.
    Both svn and cvs are affected.

23) July 23, genser

    Removed obsolete now Sensitive Detector classes/files:

     Mu2eG4/inc/CRSScintillatorBarSD.hh
     Mu2eG4/inc/ProtonAbsorberSD.hh
     Mu2eG4/inc/StoppingTargetSD.hh
     Mu2eG4/inc/VirtualDetectorSD.hh
     Mu2eG4/src/CRSScintillatorBarSD.cc
     Mu2eG4/src/ProtonAbsorberSD.cc
     Mu2eG4/src/StoppingTargetSD.cc
     Mu2eG4/src/VirtualDetectorSD.cc

22) July 21, kutschke
    SConstruct
      - Define the BaBar link libraries here so that they can be defined
        in one place and used in multiple places.
      - Update the following to get the definition of babarlibs from SConstruct
        via the environment:

    EventDisplay/src/SConscript
    FastPatternReco/src/SConscript
    KalmanTests/src/SConscript
    TrackCaloMatching/src/SConscript
    TrkPatRec/src/SConscript

    bin/createTestRelease
      - Total rewrite.  I hope no one was using it.

    bin/cleanTestRelease
      - new file.  Cleans up a test release so that it can be pointed
        at a new base release.

21) July 20, kutschke
    KalmanTests/inc/TrkStrawHit.hh
    KalmanTests/src/TrkStrawHit.cc
      Change the initialization of class statics to use the
      method of calling a static function with a function local
      static variable.

    KalmanTests/src/ReadKalFits_module.cc
    KalmanTests/test/readKalFits.fcl
       Add printout and more histograms.

20) July 20, genser

    MCDataProducts/inc/ProcessCode.hh
      Added Rayl process

    Mu2eG4/src/SConscript
    mucapture/src/SConscript
      Changed way geant4 version is decided/handled

19) July 19, kutschke
    Filters/src/MinimumHits_module.cc
      Only book histograms on the first beginRun.

18) July 19, kutschke
    Mu2eG4/src/customizeChargedPionDecay.cc
      Bug fix. The transportOnly test jobs failed because the code tried to
      modify non-existent decay tables or non-existent particles.  It now
      detects these conditions, issues a warning and continues.

17) July 19, kutschke
    Added BFieldGeom/test with example jobs to turn the Bfields in .txt
    format into binary format.  Also includes an example job to test that
    the binary file produces the same results as the text file.

16) July 17, kutschke
    Another round of breaking linkage loops.

    The files
      Mu2eUtilities/inc/PiCaptureEffects.hh
      Mu2eUtilities/src/PiCaptureEffects.cc
    were renamed to:
      EventGenerator/inc/PiCaptureEffects.hh
      EventGenerator/src/PiCaptureEffects.cc

    This class uses information from the ConditionsService so it cannot
    be in Mu2eUtilities.

    Moved:
         RecoDataProducts/inc/TrackClusterLink.hh
    to:
         TrackCaloMatching/inc/TrackClusterLink.hh

    This classes uses information from TrackCaloMatching so it cannot
    be in RecoDataProducts.  After the next round of refactoring reconstructed
    track persistency, it can go back into RecoDataProducts.

    Update the followings files to pick up the headers from their new location:
      EventGenerator/inc/PiCapture.hh
      EventGenerator/src/FromSimParticleEndPoint_module.cc
      TrackCaloMatching/src/CaloMatching_module.cc
      TrackCaloMatching/src/ReadCaloMatching_module.cc
      TrackCaloMatching/src/ReadExtrapol_module.cc

    Move the genreflex stuff for the moved data product:
      RecoDataProducts/src/classes_def.xml
      RecoDataProducts/src/classes.h
      TrackCaloMatching/src/classes.h
      TrackCaloMatching/src/classes_def.xml

    This is still one remaining file that causes a linkage loop,
    RecoDataProducts/src/CaloCluster.cc
    Giani Pezullo is refactoring this to produce a simpler data product
    class and a helper class with the additional functionality.

15) July 16, kutschke
    The method Mu2eBuilding::trackerOriginInMu2e was misnamed. It is
    really the origin of a relic coordinate system used for objects placed
    inside the MECO DS.  I renamed it to describe it correctly:
      Mu2eBuilding::relicMECOOriginInMu2e
    and changed all uses of it.  This is in prepration for getting rid
    of it entirely.

14) July 16, kutschke
    MCDataProducts/inc/GenId.hh
     - add two != operators.

13) July 15, kutschke
    A conceptually simple change that touched about 120 files.

    It also touched some BaBar files.  So you must update both
    Offline and BaBar together.  Up to now the correct revision
    of the BaBar code is 552.  After this commit it is 553.

    In order to break a linkage loop, I moved SimpleConfig and its helper
    files into a new directory, ConfigTools. In the process I moved
    TrimInPlace from Mu2eUtilties to GeneralUtilities since it can safely
    go there ( and I renamed to to trimInPlace to keep with the pattern
    that only types have a leading upper case letter ).

    Renamed to ConfigTools:
      Mu2eUtilities/inc/ConfigFileLookupPolicy.hh
      Mu2eUtilities/inc/SimpleConfig.hh
      Mu2eUtilities/inc/requireUniqueKey.hh
      Mu2eUtilities/src/SimpleConfig.cc
      Mu2eUtilities/src/SimpleConfigRecord.cc
      Mu2eUtilities/src/SimpleConfigRecord.hh
      Mu2eUtilities/src/requireUniqueKey.cc

    Renamed to GeneralUtilties/*/trimInPlace.*
      Mu2eUtilities/inc/TrimInPlace.hh
      Mu2eUtilities/src/TrimInPlace.cc

    The BaBar files that needed changing were:
      MatEnv/src/MatElmDictionary.cc
      MatEnv/src/MatIsoDictionary.cc
      MatEnv/src/MatMtrDictionary.cc

    I had to touch a lot of SConscript files to add the new library
    to the link list:
       BFieldGeom/src/SConscript
       BeamlineGeom/src/SConscript
       CalorimeterGeom/src/SConscript
       ConditionsService/src/SConscript
       CosmicRayShieldGeom/src/SConscript
       EventDisplay/src/SConscript
       EventGenerator/src/SConscript
       ExtinctionMonitorFNAL/src/SConscript
       ExtinctionMonitorUCIGeom/src/SConscript
       GeometryService/src/SConscript
       ITrackerGeom/src/SConscript
       LTrackerGeom/src/SConscript
       MBSGeom/src/SConscript
       MECOStyleProtonAbsorberGeom/src/SConscript
       Mu2eBuildingGeom/src/SConscript
       Mu2eG4/src/SConscript
       Mu2eUtilities/src/SConscript
       ProductionSolenoidGeom/src/SConscript
       ProductionTargetGeom/src/SConscript
       ProtonBeamDumpGeom/src/SConscript
       TTrackerGeom/src/SConscript
       TargetGeom/src/SConscript

     And I had to touch many .hh and .cc files to change the #include
     directives to find the new files.

12) July 15, kutschke
    Added two utility scripts:
      bin/addroot.sh
      bin/findDataFiles.sh

    See comments in the file for details of how to use them.  The short
    version is that addroot.sh will descend a directory tree, find all root
    files add and create one output file that contains the sum of all
    histograms found in the input files.  It does not add TNtuples or TTrees.

    The script findDataFiles.sh will descent a directory tree and find all
    mu2e event-data files in the tree.  It will then produce a sorted list
    of all of these file names in a format that is almost right for using
    as the input file list in a .fcl file; it needs one hand edit to get it
    right.

11) July 15, kutschke
    Add examples of how to create the input files for use by event mixing.
    See EventMixing/inputGeneration/README

10) July 10, kutschke
    Add code to control B(pi -> e nu).  The G4 default is zero.
    The new default is to set it to the PDG value.  There is a grammar
    in geom_01.txt to set it to any value on the range [0,1].

    New files:
      Mu2eG4/inc/customizeChargedPionDecay.hh
      Mu2eG4/src/customizeChargedPionDecay.cc

    Modified files:
      Mu2eG4/src/postG4InitializeTasks.cc
      Mu2eG4/test/geom_01.txt

    New files to look at the SimParticleCollection and count the number
    of decays to e nu decays and mu nu decays in the events.
      Analyses/src/CountPionDecays_module.cc
      Analyses/test/countPionDecays.fcl

9) July 10, kutschke
   Make -O3 the default compilation option.  It had been set to -O0.

8) July 10, kutschke
   KalmanTests/inc/TrkRecoTrkCollection.hh
    - included BaBar/BaBar.hh
    - previously the code worked accidentally because BaBar.h
      was included via other #included headers.

7) July 9, gianipez
   Add correction function for the calculation of the calorimeter-cluster center of gravity
   Modified files
     CaloCluster/inc/CaoClusterUtilities.hh
     CaloCluster/src/CaoClusterUtilities.cc
   Add new directory for doing the extrapolation and the matching of the reconstructed tracks with the calorimeter.
   It contains two producer modules, one for doing the extrapolation of the reconstructed tracks on the calorimeter (4vanes geometry),
   and the other for doing the matching with the custers. It contains also a new class "TrkToCaloExtrapolation.hh", which is used to fill
   the event with the extrapolation informations.
    TrackCaloMatching/
   Add a new class that is an art::Assn used for filling matching informations into the event
    Modified files:
    RecoDataProducts/inc/TrackClusterLink.hh
   Changed the calorimter 4 vanes geometry, now is 11 rows times 44 columns
    Modified files:
    Mu2eG4/test/geom_01.txt
   Add new module for studying the pile up in the calorimeter clusters
    CaloCluster/src/CaloClusterPileUp_module.cc

6) July 8, youzy
   Add position cut for Virtual Detector Filter module.
   Modified file
     Analyses/src/FilterVDHits_module.cc

5) July 3, youzy
   Add beam direction rotation in Primary Proton generator.
   Modified files.
     EventGenerator/src/PrimaryProtonGun.cc
     EventGenerator/inc/PrimaryProtonGun.hh

4) July 2, kutschke
   A new class that is a placeholder for code that persist Kalman filtered
   tracks.  So far it just put an empty collection into the event.
     TrkPatRec/inc/PayloadSaver.hh
     TrkPatRec/src/PayloadSaver.cc

   Incorporated the above class into the module that creates tracks.
    TrkPatRec/src/TrkPatRec_module.cc

3) July 2, kutschke
   Committed some prototypes ( and some placeholders ) for the classes that
   will eventually store the persistent information for fitted tracks.
   New files:
     RecoDataProducts/inc/HOTPayload.hh
     RecoDataProducts/inc/KalRepExtensionPayload.hh
     RecoDataProducts/inc/KalRepExtensionPayloadCollection.hh
     RecoDataProducts/inc/KalRepPayload.hh
     RecoDataProducts/inc/KalRepPayloadCollection.hh
     RecoDataProducts/inc/LocalHelixPayload.hh

     RecoDataProducts/src/LocalHelixPayload.cc
   Modified files.
     DataProducts/src/classes.h
     DataProducts/src/classes_def.xml
     RecoDataProducts/src/classes.h
     RecoDataProducts/src/classes_def.xml

2) July 2, kutschke
   There used to be stanza in SConstruct that checked to see if the BaBar
   Kalman filter code was present and, if not, removed from the build
   several packages that depend on the Kalman filter code.  Now that the
   Kalman filter code is required, this stanza has been removed.

   There was also a stanza skipping the build of the BaBar Dch package.
   This package has been removed from the checkout so the stanza skipping it
   was removed from SConstruct.

1) July 2, kutschke
   Force checkout of the BaBar code
    setup.sh
    setup_g4951.sh

   Replace .csh with .sh
    BaBar/status.sh
    BaBar/status.csh

   Add additional printout to:
    BaBar/update.sh

   Removed obsolete:
    BaBar/update.csh
