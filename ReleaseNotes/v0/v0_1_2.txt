    Mu2eG4/test/replayAll.py 
    Mu2eG4/test/replayWithSkip.py
    These scripts wrote an output eventdata file with the
    same name as the output root histogram file. I changed
    the name of the output event data file to avoid the
    conflict.

    ToyDP/inc/StrawHitCollection.hh 
    ToyDP/src/StrawHit.cc 
    ToyDP/src/classes.h

    New class to hold hits described in Mu2e-doc-900.

    Mu2eG4/test/g4test_03.cint
    This script makes a lot more plots than its predecesor and is designed
    to serve as a first example of a root script for those who are not 
    familiar with root.

    Mu2eG4/src/Mu2eWorld.cc
    Disabled the PS and TS fields until I fix a bug.  This bug slowed
    down g4test_02 and g4test_03 since the cosmic rays sometimes
    went through the buggy regions.

    Added the package RootAnalyzer that provides a sample job for reading
    Mu2e data files using "pure root" without any assistance from the f
    framework.  I do not recommend doing this since it requires that you
    have intimate knowledge of the structure of the root file, while
    reading data files via the framework hides those details from you.
    But some people have asked for it so here it is.

    Mu2eG4/inc/Mu2eWorld.hh
     - Create field managers for TS and PS and attach them to logical volumes.
     - Move the Calorimeter code to a new member function,
     - Move the creation of step limiters to a new member function.
     - Add step limiters for TS and PS magnetic field volumes.
     - Add control of step limits from geometry file.  It turns out that
       having a step limit speeds up field integrators.
     - control visibility of world box, dirt and hall using the variables created
       in item 9).

    - add variables to control the visibilty of the world volume, the dirt and the hall walls.

   Mu2eG4/src/constructStoppingTarget.cc
    Change name of mother volume to "StoppingTargetMother".
    I do want all target info to say either StoppingTarget or
    ProductionTarget so that there is no ambiguity.

    Mu2eG4/src/constructLTrackerv1.cc
    Mu2eG4/src/constructLTrackerv2.cc
    Mu2eG4/src/constructLTrackerv3.cc
    Mu2eG4/src/constructTTrackerv1.cc
    Mu2eG4/src/ITrackerBuilder.cc
      - The name of the mother volume is now just TrackerMother for
        all trackers, rather than LTrackerMother, TTrackerMother or
        ITrackerMother.
      - Done so that step length limiters work the same for all trackers.

6) June 23, 2010 kutschke
   Mu2eG4/src/constructLTrackerv3.cc
     - Extend the z length and radius of the mother volume so that it is big
       enough to hold the tilted sectors.

5) June 23, 2010 kutschke
   Mu2eG4/src/PrimaryGeneratorAction.cc
   EventGenerator/inc/ParticleGun.hh
   EventGenerator/src/ParticleGun.cc
    - The particle gun now gives positions in the Mu2e coordinate system,
      not in some other coordinate system.
    - Fixed bug in momentum range.
    - Removed histograms that are made obsolte by change of coordinate system.

4) June 23, 2010 kutschke
   EventGenerator/src/EventGenerator_plugin.cc 
     - cosmetic cleanup.

3) June 23, 2010 kutschke
   BFieldGeom/src/BFieldManagerMaker.cc
    - Remove debug printout.

2) June 23, 2010 kutschke
   BFieldGeom/inc/BFMap.hh
   BFieldGeom/src/BFMap.cc
    - Warning printout for request for a point outside of the map is now
      disabled by default.
    - Indices of closest grid point, (_ix, _iy, _iz), were data members.
      They are now local to the functions that calculates them and passed
      via argument to other routines.

   Until now the production target was placed with the wrong sense of the y rotation
   and the description was not clear about active vs passive rotations.
   The correct answers are documented in Mu2e-doc-938. 
   The numbers in geom_01.txt specify active rotations.
   The code changes are:  
     Mu2eG4/src/Mu2eWorld.cc 
     Mu2eG4/test/geom_01.txt
