           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v0_0_10


5) May 18, 2010 kutschke
   Put the following into the mu2e namespace.
     Mu2eG4/inc/DSField.hh and src/.cc
     Mu2eG4/inc/BFwcont.hh and src/.cc

   This required changes to:
     Mu2eG4/inc/Mu2eWorld.hh and src/.cc

   I am not sure why but the .get() method of auto_ptr<DSField> 
   was not recognized as being usable as G4MagneticField* when DSField was 
   in the mu2e namespace.  It work when DSField was out of the namespace.
   The solution was to make the auto_ptr an auto_ptr<G4MagneticField>, ie
   a pointer to base class.

4) May 18, 2010 kutschke
   Remove using declarations and directives from .hh files.
   Most were unneeded.

   Fully qualify std::string in CalorimeterGeom/inc/CrystalDetail.hh
   Fully qualify edm::ProductID in  ./ToyDP/inc/DPIndex.hh 

   The file BaBar/BaBar/include/BaBar.hh   still contains:
     using namespace CLHEP;
   which we will need to address later.

3) May 18, 2010 kutschke
   Add the trailing comments to tell emacs to use python mode to all
   SConscript files.  Add trailing comments to tell emacs to use c++ mode
   to all SimpleConfig input files.

2) May 18, 2010 kutschke
   Change all tabs to 8 spaces in .hh, .cc, .py, .txt, 
   .cint, SConscript, SConstruct.

1) May 17, 2010 genser
   Fully qualify all names from CLHEP:: and HepGeom::
   In many of the .cc files there are both fully qualified names and
   using directives. Maintainers of these files should pick one or the
   other and use them consistently.
