           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v0_0_5


Item 11 will cause previously written files of event data to become unreadable.


1) ConditionsService/*
   The first release of the ConditionsService code.
   Several files were tweaked in subsequent commits.
   In item 13 I deleted the LiveWindowEvtGen class that was added in this step.

2) Mu2eG4/test/conditions_01.txt 
   Mu2eG4/test/g4test_04.py
   To exercise the ConditionsService.

3) EventGenerator/src/ConversionGun.cc
   A trivial change to exercise the conditions service.
   Does not change the behaviour of the code.

4) HitMakers/src/MCSH_Test_plugin.cc
   Add code to show how to get a "T const *" from an "edm::Handle<T>".

5) Mu2eG4/test/geom_02.txt 
   Mu2eG4/test/geom_03.txt
   Now obsolete and have been deleted.  Before v0_0_4, these files were 
   different from geom_01.txt because they had different values for the
   G4 graphics macro.  That has been moved to the pSet for the G4 module
   so all of the geometry files are now the same.

6) Mu2eG4/src/Mu2eWorld.cc
   Removed left over debug code that was printing the names of the
   first few physical volumes.

7) Mu2eG4/test/g4test_01.py
   Mu2eG4/test/g4test_02.py 
   Mu2eG4/test/g4test_03.py 
   Mu2eG4/test/g4test_04.py
   HitMakers/test/makehits.py
   Mu2eG4/test/readback.py HitMakers/test/read.py 
   Make sure that all create the ConditionsService and that all use geom_01.txt
   Some needed both changes, some just one.

8) ConditionsService/inc/AcceleratorParams.hh 
   ConditionsService/src/AcceleratorParams.cc 
   ConditionsService/inc/DAQParams.hh 
   ConditionsService/src/DAQParams.cc     
   Added these new conditions entities.  Both have only one data member but
   I expect more will be added as time goes on.

9) Mu2eUtilities/inc/PDGCode.hh
   Added a header to define compile time constants for PDG particle ID codes.

10) ConditionsService/src/ConditionsService.cc
    Mu2eG4/test/conditions_01.txt
    Initialized the new entities added in 8.


11) ToyDP/inc/ToyGenParticle.hh 
    ToyDP/src/classes_def.xml
    In ToyGenParticle the data member _pdgId was of type int.  It is now of
    type PDGCode::type.  (see item 9) This change is to provide type safety.

12) EventGenerator/inc/CosmicToy.hh
    EventGenerator/src/ConversionGun.cc
    EventGenerator/src/CosmicToy.cc
    EventGenerator/src/ParticleGun.cc
    EventGenerator/src/PiCapture.cc
    Changed all to use 8, 9, 11.  The only magic numbers left in most of
    these files are the particle masses.  We will get those from HepPDT
    when it becomes available.

13) ConditionsService/inc/LiveWindowEvtGen.hh
    ConditionsService/src/LiveWindowEvtGen.cc
    These were not a good example of data that belongs in a conditions entity so I removed them.
