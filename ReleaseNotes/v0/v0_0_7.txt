           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v0_0_7




1) First version with a non-trival physics list.  It is just copied
   from the G4 novice example N02 so it undoubtedly needs tuning.
   This new physics list is the default behaviour.  To disable it and
   go back to the old behaviour ( which will be useful for debugging
   geometry ), change the g4.fullPhysics line in the geometry file 
   to false:

   bool g4.fullPhysics = false;

   The affected files are:
    Mu2eG4/inc/PhysicsList.hh         - the more complete physics list
    Mu2eG4/src/PhysicsList.cc  
    Mu2eG4/inc/MinimalPhysicsList.hh  - the old physics list.
    Mu2eG4/src/MinimalPhysicsList.cc
    Mu2eG4/src/G4_plugin.cc           - select one of the two lists.
    Mu2eG4/test/geom_01.txt           - user interface to select one of the lists.

2) Create a user stacking action which has a method to kill low momentum
   secondaries produced in the earth overburdern.  We can extend this to
   make other tests at stacking time.  Please segegrate each of the tests
   we develop so that they can easily be moved to separate classes once
   we get several of them.
    Mu2eG4/src/G4_plugin.cc           - register it
    Mu2eG4/inc/StackingAction.hh      - code to implement t
    Mu2eG4/inc/StackingAction.cc
    Mu2eG4/test/geom_01.txt           - New parameter g4.doCosmicKiller.

3) Added ITracker geometry.  The new code is in the directory ITrackerGeom.  
   The following routines needed changes in order to integrate the ITracker
   with existing code:
        GeometryService/src/GeometryService.cc
        GeometryService/src/SConscript
        Mu2eG4/inc/Mu2eWorld.hh
        Mu2eG4/inc/VolumeInfo.hh
        Mu2eG4/src/ConstructMaterials.cc
        Mu2eG4/src/G4_plugin.cc
        Mu2eG4/src/Mu2eWorld.cc
        Mu2eG4/src/ReadBack_plugin.cc
        Mu2eG4/src/SConscript
        Mu2eG4/test/geom_01.txt

   The chamber walls are not yet included in the geometry.

4) Added a user tracking action.
     Mu2eG4/inc/TrackingAction.hh
     Mu2eG4/src/TrackingAction.cc
     Mu2eG4/src/G4_plugin.cc

5) Renamed .Add() methods of EventNumberList to .add().
   
6) Added CVSROOT/cvsignore.
   Tell diff to ignore .os files.


7) Syntax only change to the way physics lists are set up in Mu2eG4/src/G4_plugin.cc.

8) Remove the nearest neighbours by pointer method from
   the Straw class.  This is not used anywhere and is
   unlikely to be.

9) Split LTracker code into two pieces, one part that will be common to LTracker 
   and TTracker and the part that is the LTracker proper.  The common parts are
   in the subdirectory TrackerGeom.  The LTracker specific remain in LTrackerGeom.
   The classes that were moved are:
     DeviceId, LayerId, SectorId, StrawId, StrawIndex,
     Device, Sector, Layer, Straw, StrawDetail
   Some of these classes had both .hh and .cc files, others only .cc

10) Added the following files to define the common interface that is shared between
    the LTracker and the TTracker.  There is very little common interface: just code
    to return straw geometry info given an indentifier of that straw.
       TrackerGeom/inc/Tracker.hh
       TrackerGeom/src/Tracker.cc
    At some time we will need to extend this so that all 3 trackers have a
    small, but important amount, of common interface.

    Tracker.hh inherits from Detector.hh, so that all Trackers can be managed by 
    the Geometry Service.

11) The following files were changed match the changes made in 9 and 10:
      LTrackerGeom/inc/CrudeStrawHitCollection.hh
      LTrackerGeom/inc/LTracker.hh
      LTrackerGeom/inc/LTrackerMaker.hh
      LTrackerGeom/src/LTrackerMaker.cc
      LTrackerGeom/src/SConscript
      Mu2eG4/src/StrawPlacer.cc
      ToyDP/inc/CrudeStrawHit.hh
      ToyDP/inc/ProtoStrawCluster.hh
      ToyDP/inc/StepPointMC.hh

11) TrackerGeom/inc/TubsParams.hh
    A struct to simplify communication between the Geometry service and G4.
