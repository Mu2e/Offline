    Bug fix.  
         else if (dolabels=3)
      should be
         else if (dolabels==3)

    ../HitMakers/src/MakeDPIStrawCluster_plugin.cc
    ../HitMakers/src/ReadDPIStrawCluster_plugin.cc
    to run it use:
    mute HitMakers/test/makeDPIStrawClusters.py
    This will run the Hit maker and the Cluster maker

    Mu2e/G4/src/CosmicTuple.cc and CosmicTuple.hh files were changed.
    A new logic based on SimParticlesWithHits are used for the search
    of the cosmic originated track candidates in the tracker

    In many SConscript files there was a line that was uneccessary because
    the variable on the left hand side was never used.
       home = os.environ['FRAMEWORK_DIR']
    I removed these lines from many SConscript files.

    Same issue as item 6.  Fix in several additional files.
      Mu2eG4/inc/StackingAction.hh

   BkgRates_plugin.cc has changed a little its output tree structure. In the previous
   version the informations about generated particle were associated to the hits.
   It was difficult to extract spectra of generated particles per events.
   Now each hit has an entry with the information of the generated particle, 
   independently from the energy deposition of the generated track. This structure
   implies that only one background particle must be generated for each event. 
>>>>>>> 1.12

   The compiler version was hard coded into the boost iostream library name.
   Gets the version from the environment.

   In these two classes, there is a static assert in the .cc file.
   With gcc 4.1, these fail because the variable _name was private.
   For now make the variable public; later replace with a static function.
     ToyDP/inc/ProcessCode.hh 
     ToyDP/inc/GenId.hh

   d'tor should have been declared virtual.  It was absent so it has
   been added.
     BFieldGeom/inc/BFMapBase.hh 
     BFieldGeom/src/BFMapBase.cc

6) January 28, 2011 kutschke
   The gcc 4.1 compiler is much picker than 3.4. The older compiler permitted
   a construct that is in fact an error:

   class T{
      void T::function();
   };
   The T:: prefix on the names of class members is illegal.  

   This was fixed in:
    Analyses/src/CEL_plugin.cc

    - add a little more information to the printout

   Added Cosmic Ray Shield to the Geometry Service; 
   Rewrote Mu2eG4/src/constructSteel.cc using Geometry Service and its
   newly created Cosmic Ray Shield info

   The BkgRates_plugin.cc has now new features for the calorimeter
   section. A new class, called MCCaloUtilities, can give easy access
   to information about calorimeter. It has to be instantiated once in 
   a module, then one can pass the class a track and a RO, and
   then get the local corresponding crystal, vane, and original
   vane where the track comes from. This class is intended to be
   extended with more accessors, if they will be required.
   It is located in Mu2eUtilities.
   To make the code compile correctly, the SConscript files in
   Analyses/src and ConditionService/src have been changed.

   Moved constructWorldVolume, constructDirt, constructHall,
   constructProtonAbsorber, constructSteel, constructVirtualDetectors,
   constructDS, constructTS, constructPS out of Mu2eWorld to make them
   free functions in separate files; factored out constructWorldVolume
   from constructDirt.
   Added getMu2eOriginInWorld() to G4Helper/inc/VolumeInfo.hh

   Replaced G4Helper with G4Helper_plugin in Mu2eG4/src/SConscript

   Remove StoppingCode class and replace with ProcessCode.  The ProcessCode
   class is used to report both stopping codes and creation codes for SimParticles.
   The ProcessCode also contains an extra item: mu2ePrimary which is the creation
   code for particles from the event generator.
     inc/StoppingCode.hh 
     src/StoppingCode.cc
     inc/ProcessCode.hh 
     src/ProcessCode.cc

   Replace StoppingCode with ProcessCode. Add creationCode data member and accessor
     ToyDP/inc/SimParticle.hh

   Replace StoppingCode with ProcessCode
      ToyDP/src/classes_def.xml
      Mu2eG4/inc/PhysicsProcessInfo.hh 
      Mu2eG4/inc/UserTrackInformation.hh 
      Mu2eG4/inc/SteppingAction.hh 
      Mu2eG4/src/SteppingAction.cc  

    Replace  StoppingCode with ProcessCode.  Also change the beginRun code to report
    all unknown processes before throwing (used to throw on each).  Changed comment
    to refer to a web page.
       Mu2eG4/src/PhysicsProcessInfo.cc

    Replace StoppingCode with ProcessCode.  Also add creationCode to SimParticles.
