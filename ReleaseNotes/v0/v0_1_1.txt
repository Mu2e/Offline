           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v0_1_1



5) June 22, 2010 kutschke
   Major rewrite of magnetic field management.
   Created a new package BFieldGeom to hold the information about magnetic fields.
   Created a BFieldGeom/inc/BFieldManager that lives inside the GeometryService.
   The BFieldManager holds magnetic field maps in objects of type BFieldGeom/BFMap.
   The G4 code uses these maps via objects of type Mu2eG4/inc/FieldMgr.hh
   A few other utility classes were added to make this happen and a few classes
   were moved from Mu2eG4 to BFieldGeom.
   
   Replaced by BFieldGeom/inc/BFMap.hh
     Mu2eG4/inc/BFwcont.hh
     Mu2eG4/src/BFwcont.cc

   Moved to BFieldGeom/inc
     Mu2eG4/inc/Container3D.hh
     Mu2eG4/inc/DiskRecord.hh

   Obsolete
     Mu2eG4/inc/Record.hh

   New utility class:
    GeneralUtilities/inc/MinMax.hh
    GeneralUtilities/src/MinMax.cc

   New class to interface magnetic fields to G4:
     Mu2eG4/inc/FieldMgr.hh
     Mu2eG4/src/FieldMgr.cc

   New package to manage magnetic fields:
     BFieldGeom

   Define the information needed by the BFieldManager:
     Mu2eG4/test/geom_01.txt

   Major rewrites use the new system:
     Mu2eG4/inc/DSField.hh
     Mu2eG4/src/DSField.cc 
     Mu2eG4/inc/Mu2eWorld.hh
     Mu2eG4/src/Mu2eWorld.cc

   Small changes:
     GeometryService/src/GeometryService.cc
       - create BFieldManager if request.
     GeometryService/src/SConscript
       - add BFieldGeom library to link dependencies

   When the CLHEP namespace change was made ( Release notes v0_0_10, item 1 ),
   the scripts also changed units that appear in titles, such as "Drift Distance, mm",
   which was changed to "Drift Distance, CLHEP::mm".  This change restores these
   to their correct form.

3) June 17, 2010 kutschke
   Removed setups.sh since it is no longer needed. ( It setup old style ups/upd. )

2) June 17, 2010 kutschke
   Mu2eG4/src/constructLTrackerv3.cc
   Straws in LTrackerv3 are now made invisible in a way that does not leak memory.

1) June 15, 2010 kutschke 
   Mu2eG4/src/Mu2eWorld.cc 
     - Change default LTracker to v3 ( now that the octagon sides
       are bounded by trapezoids.  See ReleaseNotes/v0_0_12.txt item 1).
     - This change makes the code faster.  The bug with overlaps is
       now removed; v3 even correctly finds some straws that v1 missed!

   Mu2eG4/test/transportOnlyGeom.txt
     - no longer need to override default LTracker.
