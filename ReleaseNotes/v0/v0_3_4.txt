           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v0_3_4


52) May 17, 2011 onoratog
    A new bkg generator has been added: NuclearCaptureGun.
    It includes EjectedProtons, EjectedNeutrons plus photons.
    The input position and time of captured muons is taken from a txt file
    ConditionsService/data/StoppedMuons.txt
    The multiplicity of nuclear capture and relative products can
    be set from parameter file. An example is in 
    Mu2eG4/test/genconfig_05.txt
    In the parameter file one can set also the coordinate system
    used by the input file (Mu2e or G4BeamLine).
    A feature has been added to FPG, that is the possibility        
    of adding a delay in time production due to the 
    the proton pulse and the transport from PS to DS.
    Every generator usinf FPG can use it.
    The new generator is a prototype. It needs to be tested again but 
    it compiles. Moreover the input file of stopped muons is a dummy file
    and the energy spectrum of photons is flat.

    New conditions entity that applies tracker calibrations.
       ConditionsService/inc/TrackerCalibrations.hh
       ConditionsService/src/TrackerCalibrations.cc

    Modified to make the new entity available:
       ConditionsService/src/ConditionsService.cc

    Modified to use the new entity:
       HitMakers/src/MakeStrawHit_plugin.cc

50) May 16, 2011 kutschke
    A new plugin to play with looking at tracks.
      Analyses/src/HitDisplay_plugin.cc 
      Analyses/test/hitDisplay.py   

    Some new utilities to support the above.  
      Mu2eUtilities/inc/SortedStepPoints.hh 
      Mu2eUtilities/src/SortedStepPoints.cc 
      Mu2eUtilities/inc/TrackTool.hh 
      Mu2eUtilities/src/TrackTool.cc 

49) May 16, 2011 kutschke
    A new class in which I will add diagnostic histograms for G4.
    It is called at appropriate places inside G4_plugin.cc
    This is done in a separate class to avoid clutter inside G4_plugin.cc.
    This class is not a module, despite having module-sounding names.
      Mu2eG4/inc/DiagnosticsG4.hh
      Mu2eG4/src/DiagnosticsG4.cc
      Mu2eG4/src/G4_plugin.cc

48) May 16, 2011 kutschke
    Allow analyses to proceed if the status G4 is <=1; this allows
    events that have some truncated tracks to be analyzed.  
    A track is truncated if it takes too many steps.  
      Analyses/src/Summary01_plugin.cc
      Mu2eG4/src/ReadBack.cc

47) May 15, 2011 kutschke
    EventGenerator/src/DecayInOrbitGun.cc
       Change default cos(theta) range to [-1.,1.).  
       Tweak diagnostic histograms.

46) May 15, 2011 kutschke
    Mu2eUtilities/src/ShankerWanatabeSpectrum.cc
      The path to the file with the table of the energy spectrum was hardcoded to
      be in  ConditionsService/data/.
      Use FileInPath so that we can run from a test release too.

45) May 15, 2011 kutschke
    A new plugin that I am developing to document the events
    that were created for the TTracker pattern recognition studies.
      Analyses/src/Summary01_plugin.cc

44) May 15, 2011 kutschke
    Throw if there is not at least one foil defined.
      TargetGeom/src/TargetMaker.cc

43) May 15, 2011 kutschke
    No change in behaviour.  Added histograms to document what the generator did.
    Did some cleanup.
     EventGenerator/inc/ConversionGun.hh 
     EventGenerator/src/ConversionGun.cc


42) May 15, 2011 kutschke
    A new free function to determine a sensible binning for a histogram
    of z positions in the range of the target foils. This ensures that the
    foil centers are always at bin centers.  Also define a return type to
    hold the binning information.

      GeneralUtilities/inc/Binning.hh 
      TargetGeom/inc/zBinningForFoils.hh
      TargetGeom/src/zBinningForFoils.cc  


41) May 15, 2011 kutschke
    Followup on item 40.  When the minimum kinetic energy cut is present in the
    run time configuration, then it is now also be applied in StackingAction.
    Also, when g4SteppingAction.killLowEKine is true, then
    g4SteppingAction.eKineMin is now a required parameter - that is the code will
    throw if it is not present.  This ensures that the same cut value is used
    in both SteppingAction and StackingAction.
       Mu2eG4/inc/StackingAction.hh
       Mu2eG4/src/StackingAction.cc
       Mu2eG4/src/SteppingAction.cc

    Note on order of operations in G4. The SteppingAction is called at the end of
    a step.  In particular it is called after the sensitive detector codes have been
    called.  Before the changes in item 40 and 41, when the minimum kinetic energy
    cut was present, the cut was not applied until the end of the first step.  Therefore,
    if a track were created with a kinetic energy below the cut, and if were created
    in a senstive detector, the sensitive detector code would be called, and a hit created,
    before the track was killed in the first call to SteppingAction. This will no longer
    happen because the track will be killed in the StackingAction.

40) May 15, 2011 kutschke
    Renamed some the G4 run-time configuration variables.  User files that change these
    variables will need to be updated.

       g4SteppingAction.eKineMin     becomes: g4.eKineMin
       g4SteppingAction.killLowEKine becomes: g4.killLowEKine

    These variables will be now be used in StackingAction as well as in SteppingAction.

       Analyses/test/geomCRV.txt
       Mu2eG4/src/SteppingAction.cc

39) May 12, 2011 kutschke
    Small changes to enable test releases:
      setup.sh
      bin/addlocal.sh
      bin/setup_mu2e_project.sh
    New scripts to create a test releases and to add packages to a release:
      bin/createTestRelease
      bin/newPackage

38) May 12, 2011 kutschke
    There are two places in which a minimum energy cut was applied as an example of 
    how to apply a minimum energy cut.  I just learned that people have copied these
    defaults when they should not have.  So the defaults have been set to 0.
    This may slow down some codes signficantly.  If it is appropriate for your problem
    renable the cuts:
      Mu2eG4/test/geom_01.txt
         double g4SteppingAction.eKineMin      = 0.0; // Kinetic energy in MeV
         was previously 0.1
      Mu2eG4/test/g4test_03.py
         In the parameter set for ReadBack
            minimumEnergy        = mu2e.double(0.000),
         Previously it was 0.001


37) May 12, 2011 kutschke
    Minor changes to remove compiler warnings.  These should not change
    any behaviour.
      CDFTrajectory/inc/Circle2D.hh
         - initializer lists out of order - no functional error.
      CDFFitting/inc/ConfidenceLevelComputer.icc
         - comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions
      HitMakers/src/ReadDPIStrawCluster_plugin.cc
         - commented out the declaration of unused variables
      HitMakers/src/ReadStrawCluster_plugin.cc
         - first clause of a for loop had not effect; just remove it, 
           leaving a blank clause.

36) May 12, 2011 kutschke
    Renamed RootAnalyzer/src/SConscript to RootAnalyzer/src/SConscript.sav

    To make the old file go away, remember the -P argument in: cvs update -PdA
    
    The build of this directory does not work because the code contains hardcoded 
    information about the shape of the data product classes; this code was not updated
    after the shape of some classes changed. So it needs maintenance.  This code is
    meant to be illustrative of how to read a data file outside of the framework.
    It is not needed for most purposes.  For now, just take it out of the build.

35) May 12, 2011 kutschke
    SConstruct will now work either in a base release or a test release.
      - It is now driven from environment variables MU2E_BASE_RELEASE and MU2E_TEST_RELEASE
    Renamed some inappropriately named internal variables.

34) May 10, 2011 onoratog
    Bug fixed in DIOShankerWanatabe.cc [.hh]. The constructor of the energy 
    spectrum PDF need the size of the table the PDF is taken from.
    Those size was initialized only after the first calling of the object, 
    so the number of bins of the PDF was a random number.
    Now it works properly.   

33) May 9, 2011 onoratog
    EjectedNeutronGun generator added to the framework. The energy spectrum
    comes from MARS simulation and is reported in 
    ConditionsService/data/neutronSpectrum.txt
    The configuration file      
    Mu2eG4/test/genconfig_05.txt
    contains an example of how to use the new generator. It is basically
    identical to the EjectedProtonGun generator.

32) May 9, 2011 onoratog
    Two features have been added to BkgRates_plugin.cc.
    i. Evaluation of radiation absorbed by crystal in the calorimeter
    in Gray.
    ii. Possibility of skipping events where the generated track is stopped
    by the ST foils. It could be used when reading events coming from the PS.
    The possibility of skip those events is controlled by a boolean flag
    in the py file. It works properly only if the config file reads one 
    particle per event.

31) May 5, 2011 kutschke
    A job to pick up pi+ that are stopped in foils (from G4beamline),
    create positrons from pi-> e nu decay, run these through G4 and
    make hits:

      Mu2eG4/test/pi_e_nu.py 
      Mu2eG4/test/pi_e_nu_geom.txt 
      Mu2eG4/test/pi_e_nu_genconfig.txt 

30) May 5, 2011 kutschke
    Require generatorModuleLabel in the parameter set.
       Mu2eG4/src/ReadBack.cc 
       Mu2eG4/src/ReadBack.hh

    This is needed to distinguish the ToyGenParticleCollections made in
    item 28 from ones made by EventGenerator_plugin.

29) May 5, 2011 kutschke
    A new geometry file.  It includes geom_01.txt and makes many details
    invisible. The full details are still present in the simulation, they
    are just not draw in the G4 visualization. This is done to speed up 
    rendering.  
      Mu2eG4/test/geom_01_LowDetailGraphics.txt

    Use this new geometry file:
      Mu2eG4/test/g4test_01.py 
      Mu2eG4/test/g4test_02.py
      Mu2eG4/test/beamline_geom.txt

28) May 5, 2011 kutschke
    New event generator module.  It reads an existing ToyGenParticleCollection
    and creates a new, modified one.
      EventGenerator/src/EplusFromStoppedPion_plugin.cc 

27) May 5, 2011 kutschke
    An up coming change to Mu2eG4/src/ReadBack.cc will require
    that the the parameter sets for these modules contain:

    generatorModuleLabel=mu2e.string("label_of_generator_module")

      EffyNoise/test/simpleENtest_01.py

26) May 5, 2011 kutschke
      ToyDP/inc/GenId.hh
    Add a new code for ePlusfromStoppPi.  ToyGenParticles with this
    code will be made by:
    EventGenerator/src/EplusFromStoppedPion_plugin.cc

25) May 5, 2011 kutschke
      EventGenerator/inc/FromG4BLFile.hh
      EventGenerator/src/FromG4BLFile.cc
    Rework the treatment of the input coordinate system.  See the
    comments in the code for details.
    
    Added a list of pdgIds to accept.  If the list is empty, accept
    all ids.  If it is not empty, then only accept particles from
    the input file if they match one of the ids in the list.


24) May 5, 2011 kutschke
      Mu2eUtc/SimpleConfig.hh   
      Mu2eUtilities/src/SimpleConfig.cc
    Bug fix: the two getHep3Vector methods are now both const methods.
    New features: optional default values for getVector* methods.

23) May 2, 2011 kutschke
    Added a utility routine to compute the kinematics of
    two body decay:
      GeneralUtilities/inc/TwoBodyKinematics.hh 
      GeneralUtilities/src/TwoBodyKinematics.cc

22) May 2, 2011 kutschke
    Added a scale factor for the magnetic field map:

      Mu2eG4/test/geom_01.txt
      BFieldGeom/inc/BFMap.hh
      BFieldGeom/inc/BFieldManager.hh
      BFieldGeom/src/BFMap.cc
      BFieldGeom/src/BFieldManager.cc
      BFieldGeom/src/BFieldManagerMaker.cc

    This was added to study a candidate technique for absolute calibration
    of the momentum scale of the TTracker: pi+ stopped in production targets, 
    decaying at rest to e nu.

    Use this with care:
      If we ramp down the currents in the DS coils, to about 2/3 of their nominal
      values, then the monoenergetic electrons from this process will fall
      within the acceptance of the tracker and can provide a line for
      calibration.  This scale factor is provided to allow for a crude study of
      this process.

      Why only a crude stduy?  Because of the presence of the iron return yoke,
      the magnetic field in the tracker does not linearly scale with coil currents.
      So this scale factor is an approximation.  Moreover, the factor is applied
      everywhere in the field map, which is probably not what we would do in 
      real life; in particular it would change the transmission characteristics
      of the TS.

21) May 2, 2011 kutschke
    The example cint files call WaitPrimitive on the active TCanvas. 
    It should be called on the active TPad.  Now fixed.
      Example02/test/ex02.cint 
      Mu2eG4/test/display_03.cint 
      Mu2eG4/test/g4test_03.cint 
      Mu2eG4/test/readback0.cint

20) April 29, 2011 kutschke
    There was one wrongly placed call and one unnecessary call to:
       _UI->ApplyCommand("/vis/scene/endOfEventAction refresh");
    These are fixed.  Removed stale, commented out code.
      Mu2eG4/src/G4_plugin.cc

19) April 29, 2011 kutschke
      Mu2eG4/src/constructCalorimeter.cc 
      Mu2eG4/test/geom_01.txt

    In the old version there was one flag to control the visibility of all elements
    of the calorimeter.  There are now two:
      bool calorimeter.vaneBoxVisible = true;
      bool calorimeter.crystalVisible = false;
    The default is to draw the vanes but not the individual crystals (much faster).
    The crystalVisible flag controls both the crystals and the readout devices
    attached to them.
    You can also control the solid/outline representation separately:
      bool calorimeter.vaneBoxSolid   = true;
      bool calorimeter.crystalSolid   = true;


18) April 29, 2011 kutschke
    Expanded printout about SimParticles to include information 
    about where and how the particle stopped.
     Mu2eG4/src/ReadBack.cc

17) April 29, 2011 kutschke
    Added an option to only stack primary particles. Useful for event displays.
      Mu2eG4/inc/StackingAction.hh 
      Mu2eG4/src/StackingAction.cc 
    This is off by default and can be turned on by the following in geom_01.txt
      bool g4.stackPrimaryOnly = true;       

16) April 29, 2011 genser 

    Improved the Muon Beam Stop (MBS) implementation by rewriting
    DS3Vacuum as a subtraction solid to limit DS3Vacuum extension to
    the MBS only, to be able to make the MBS Iron Yoke opening smaller
    and to place the new elements external to MBS in the hall air.
    added conditional diagnostic printout; added comments
      CosmicRayShieldGeom/src/CosmicRayShieldMaker.cc
      Mu2eG4/src/constructDS.cc
      Mu2eG4/src/constructMBS.cc

15) April 25, 2011 genser 

    Added Muon Beam Stop (MBS) and related elements of the Cryostat in geant4;
    Added an opening in CRSSteelDownstreamShield to accomodate MBS;
    Extended DS3 vacuum to accommodate MBS (as a temporary measure);
    Extended/Repositioned CRV to accommodate MBS;
    Added/changed diagnostic printout also to help the z alignment
    (this included using VolumeInfo and not G4LogicalVolume* in constructCalorimeter);
    Added Stainless Steel material;

14) April 7,  2011 onoratog
    File timeDelayDist.txt moved from EventGenerator/src to
    ConditionsService/data/ in order to be found in the path
    within grid jobs.

13) March 26, 2011 ehrlich
    EventDisplay/src/SConscript
    EventDisplay/src/RootDictMakeFile

    EventDisplayDict gets updated (and compiled) 
    only if the relevant header files were modified

12) March 21, 2011 genser 
     Added support rings to the ttracker; used G4_Al as the material
       Mu2eG4/test/ttracker_v0.txt
       TTrackerGeom/inc/TTrackerMaker.hh
       TTrackerGeom/src/TTrackerMaker.cc
       Mu2eG4/src/constructTTrackerv3.cc

     Changed manifold layout to resemble more the current design
     without changing the straw positions
       Mu2eG4/test/ttracker_v2.txt


12) March 31, 2011 onoratog
    FoilParticleGenerator now has the possibility of introducing a 
    time shift in the generation of particle from foils.
    This time shift is extracted randomly from the time distribution
    of the stopped muons in the ST, where t=0 is the primary proton
    impacting the production target.
    This feature is on by default. You can turn it off by adding a 
    false boolean as last parameter of the FPG constructor.
    I turned it off for the PiCapture generator. 


11) March 21, 2011 onoratog
    THe generator module "FromG4BLFile" now can skip custom number 
    of particles in the input file. The number of lines (particles) 
    to skip has to be set in the genconfig file using the line:
    fromG4BLFile.particlesToSkip = n
    0 is the default value

10) March 18, 2011 genser 
     Added CRV Bar StepPointMC histogram in 
       Mu2eG4/src/ReadBack.cc
       Mu2eG4/src/ReadBack.hh
     Added a comment in 
     CosmicRayShieldGeom/inc/CosmicRayShield.hh

      Mu2eG4/src/StackingAction.cc
      Mu2eG4/inc/StackingAction.hh
      Mu2eG4/test/geom_01.txt
    The changes include a possibility of making cut on particle momentum
    if its position in the dirt is above the dirt bottom by some value
    given by the geom_01.txt (currently double g4.yaboveDirtYmin = 0.
    which means whole dirt).

08) March 17, 2011 genser 
     Added CRV U shield; extended shields R,T,B; modified shield's
     offsets; updated comments; made data private in
     CRSScintillatorBar, Layer, Module; 
     in constructCRV.cc: factored out code from the shield loop;
     changed color of the scintillator bars;

07) March 17, 2011 onoratog
    The BkgRates_plugin now supports also the ITracker. 
    To work with ITracker A line about ITracker
    have to be uncommented in Analyses/test/BkgRatesCounter.py, and the corrispective
    lines about TTracker must be commented. In the geometry file the ITracker must
    be activated.

     Mu2eG4/inc/StackingAction.hh 
     Mu2eG4/src/StackingAction.cc 
     Mu2eG4/test/beamline_geom.txt

    I defined a new control switch for G4. It goes into the
    geometry file.

    This variable is a list of PDG Ids.  When G4 creates
    a sees a new particle, it will only stack the particle if the
    particle has an ID in this list.  The example here is a muon.
    vector<int> g4.stackingActionKeepPDG = { 13 };

    This functionality is the opposite of the previously existing
    option:
    vector<int> g4.stackingActionDropPDG = { 22, 11, -11 }

    This option was misnamed g4.steppingActionDropPDG.  It is now fixed.

    One may specify either list in any job.  If one specifies both lists,
    the job will throw.

    The only example file that used the old option is beamline_geom.txt


05) March 15, 2011 kutschke

02) March 09, 2011 kutschke
    Tell StackingAction about the y extent of the dirt volume.
       Mu2eG4/inc/Mu2eWorld.hh       - Record the y extent information
       Mu2eG4/src/Mu2eWorld.cc
       Mu2eG4/src/G4_plugin.cc       - Pass info from Mu2eWorld to StackingAction
       Mu2eG4/inc/StackingAction.hh  - Receive information at beginRun time.
