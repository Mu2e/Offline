           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v0_2_6


 9) October 13 2010, kutschke
    The default field in the DS is now the version with the full field in the target
    region and the constant field in the tracker+calorimeter volume.
    I have changed all of the genconfig files that make conversion electrons so that
    are now created on the range -0.5<cos(theta)<0.5.  I am not sure that this is
    really correct but it is closer to right than the asymmetic range used when we
    did not use the gradient in the field in the target region.

    New class to find information about the generated conversion electron.
       Mu2eG4/inc/ConvElecUtilities.hh
       Mu2eG4/src/ConvElecUtilities.cc

 7) October 13 2010, kutschke
    A new script to read data_03.root and write a new output file containing only the
    save random number state.  This file is used by replay*.py.
      Mu2eG4/test/drop03.py

 6) October 13 2010, kutschke
    In all of the .py files the syntax for defining the RandomNumberGeneratorService
    was different than that for all other Services.  This was due to requirements imposed
    by an older version of the framework; this constraint has been removed and it can
    now be defined in the normal way and I have done this.
 
    Mu2eG4/test/*.py

    Except for:
      Mu2eG4/test/readback.py

    in which I removed the random number generator entirely.

 5) October 13 2010, kutschke
    Add a new stripped down first example with much less complexity than ReadBack.cc
