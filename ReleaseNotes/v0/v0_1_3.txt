    Mu2eG4/test/ttracker_v0.txt
    Mu2eG4/test/ttracker_meco.txt
    Mu2eG4/test/ltracker_v0.txt
    Mu2eG4/test/itracker_v0.txt
    Mu2eG4/test/dummytracker.txt
     - Moved tracker varaibles from geom_01.txt to their own files.
     - This was needed so that we can have two different TTrackers.
     - Exacly one of these files should be included in geom_01.txt. 
     - If two are included there should be a runtime error.

    TTrackerGeom/src/TTrackerMaker.cc
     - This version, release 1.7 is the first to properly do the Aseet TTracker.
       Relative to Aseet's note, some numbering conventions are off.
     - Release 1.8 removes some debug printout from 1.7

16) August 12, 2010 genser
    Work on fixing bugs in magnetic field code and on speeding up the 
    interpolation code.

     BFieldGeom/inc/Container3D.hh
       - fixed bug in bounds check code.
       - For speed: change test of >=0 to > -1 
     BFieldGeom/inc/BFMap.hh
     BFieldGeom/src/BFMap.cc
      - bug fixes in the interpolation code
      - The small 3x3x3 array was implemented as a Container3D.
        Change it to a static fixed size ordinary array.  This
        greatly improves the speed.
    
     SConstruct
      - add -O2 compilation flag for all code.
      - Greatly improves the speed of the magnetic field interpolation code.

     Mu2eG4/src/Mu2eWorld.cc
      - Change stepper for non-uniform fields to be SimpleRunge, not ExplictEuler.
      - This speeds up the code.  We have not yet tested if it affects accuracy.
 
15) August 11, 2010 kutschke
    Mu2eG4/src/Mu2eWorld.cc
     - finally correctly fixed the screwup described in 11 and 14.
     - All of the changes by rhbob and genser are now in place. 

14) August 10, 2010 rhbob
    Mu2eG4/src/Mu2eWorld.cc
     - Added the complicated downstream face to the steel return yoke.
     - This was built on the version from 12) so it is still broken.

13) August 10, 2010, kutschke
     SConstruct
     CalorimeterGeom/inc/CrystalId.hh
     CalorimeterGeom/src/CalorimeterMaker.cc
     GeometryService/test/SConscript
     Mu2eG4/src/CosmicTuple.cc
     Mu2eG4/src/CosmicTuple.hh
     Mu2eG4/src/G4_plugin.cc
     Mu2eG4/src/Mu2eWorld.cc

       -  Fix tabs and non-standard formatting.

12) August 10, 2010, kutschke
    Mu2eG4/inc/Mu2eWorld.hh
    Mu2eG4/src/Mu2eWorld.cc
     - failed attempt to fix screwup in 11.  It is still broken in this version (1.40)
     - did not notice that geom_01.txt was also broken.


11) August 9, 2010, rhbob
    Mu2eG4/src/Mu2eWorld.hh
    Mu2eG4/src/Mu2eWorld.cc
     - Added steel for the return yoke and cosmic ray shield.  Added only five
       sides of the box, leaving the complicated upstream face undone.
     - Major screw up in the .cc file
        - This is release 1.39
        - This was done relative to release 1.34, not 1.38.  So
          changes from genser in item 9) are lost.
     - The screw up is not fixed properly until item ...

    Mu2eG4/test/geom_01.txt
     - Add variables for the steel return yoke.
     - Major screw p.
         - This is release 1.37
         - This was made from release 1.33, not 1.36. So changes from
           genser item 9) are lost
     - The screw up is not fixed properly until item ...

10) August 4, 2010, timothym
    Mu2eG4/test/geom_cosmic.txt
     - use the include syntax to include the standard geometry

    Mu2eG4/test/runCosmic.py
     - new cut values.  See item 8.

9) July 19, 2010 to July 30, genser
   A lot of changes to update the G4 representation of the TTracker in order
   to improve processing time, particularly voxelization time, and the memory
   footprint.  Plus a few related changes to the LTracker.

   Mu2eG4/inc/constructTTracker.hh
    - declare constructTTrackerv2 and 

   Mu2eG4/src/constructTTrackerv1.cc
    - control visibility from variables in the geometry file.

   Mu2eG4/src/constructTTrackerv2.cc
    - First and second releases. Deeper G4 geometry ( envelope volume for
      each device ).  Faster voxelization.
    - control visibility from variables in the geometry file.

   Mu2eG4/src/constructTTrackerv3.cc
    - Even deeper G4 geometry ( envelope volume for each sector ). Faster
      voxelization.  This is now the preferred version.
    - control visibility from variables in the geometry file.

   Mu2eG4/src/StrawSD.cc
   Mu2eG4/inc/StrawSD.hh
    - make this work with both TTracker geometries, v1, v2 and v3.

   Mu2eG4/src/Mu2eWorld.cc
    - pick which TTracker version to use, v1, v2 or v3.
    - control visibility from variables in the geometry file.

   Mu2eG4/src/constructTTrackerv1.cc
    - Changes to logic that chooses which straws to draw (used in debugging). 
      Usually straws are not drawn because they cannot be seen well and they
      take a long time to draw.

   TTrackerGeom/src/TTrackerMaker.cc
   TTrackerGeom/inc/TTrackerMaker.hh
    - add method computeSectorBoxParams which computes the parameters of
      a trapezoid that encloses all elements in a sector.

   Mu2eG4/test/transportOnly.py 
    - Add parameterset parameter to control G4 verbosity.

    Mu2eG4/test/visxy.mac
     - No net change.  Committed a wrong version and restored the previous one.

   Mu2eG4/src/nestTubs.cc  
     - debug code for overlap checks.

   Mu2eG4/src/nestTrp.cc  

   Mu2eG4/src/constructLTrackerv3.cc
    - control visibility from variables in the geometry file.


8) July 13, 2010, timothym
   Mu2eG4/src/CosmicTuple.cc
   Mu2eG4/src/CosmicTuple.hh
   - Add new cuts.
  
7) July 7, 2010, genser
   Mu2eG4/src/G4_plugin.cc
   - In the event display section, at the "continue" prompt, add option to 
     enter interactive G4 session.

6) July 7, 2010, genser
   Mu2eG4/src/Mu2eG4RunManager.cc
   Mu2eG4/inc/Mu2eG4RunManager.hh
   - The method UpdateScoring, was private in the base class G4RunManager,
     so we had to duplicate it in this class; this worked because UpdateScoring
     did all of its work on objects there were accessible to the derived class.
     The method is no longer private so no longer need an implementation here.
     It has been removed.

5) July 7, 2010, genser
   Mu2eG4/test/geom_01.txt
   - Add variables to control which objects are drawn solid and which
     in outline.

   Mu2eG4/src/Mu2eWorld.cc
   Mu2eG4/src/constructCalorimeter.cc
   Mu2eG4/src/constructTTrackerv1.cc
   Use new variables geom_01.txt (2 and 5) to control visibility and
   visual representation of objects.

4) July 6, 2010, rhbob
   GeneralUtilities/inc/DynamicArray.hh
   - A template to make dynamically resizeable 2D arrays.  After 
     some discussion we decided not to use this.  The application
     in questions does not need resizeable arrays and there are 
     better implementations in external libraries, like boost's
     multi-array. See discussion in Mu2e-sim mailing list in 
     early July 2010.

3) July 6, 2010, rhbob
   Mu2eG4/test/geom_01.txt
   - Add parameters for crystal calorimeter, MECO version.

2) July 2, 2010, genser
   Mu2eG4/test/geom_01.txt
   - Add variables to control visibility of G4 volumes.


1) July 2, 2010, genser
   TTrackerGeom/src/TTrackerMaker.cc
   TTrackerGeom/inc/TTrackerMaker.hh
   - First implementation of the Aseet TTracker, following work by Vadim Rusu.
   - This forms stations in z and changes 4 sides to 6 but it does not correctly
     rotate the two planes in a station.
   - This is fixed in item 17.
