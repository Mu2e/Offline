           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v0_2_7


11) Nov 2, 2010 kutschke
    The geometry service optionally loads the beamline and virtual
    detector information.  Previously it always loaded that information.
    The in GeometryService.cc is that a subdetector is not loaded unless
    it is explicitly requested in the geometry file.

    More improvements to the FoilParticleGenerator class.
    Implement a second model of the distribution over the
    foils; this model comes from Rick Coleman, exponential fall
    off over the foils.  Most of the generators touched because 
    of a change to the  interface.

   The first implementation of FoilParticleGenerator moved too much 
   functionality into the new class.  It generated the momentum
   and particle Id as well as the spatial and temporal information  
   This has been fixed so that FoilParticlGenerator only generates 
   the spatial and temporal information.

   Several of the event generators have repeated code to compute a
   random position within the target system and a random time at which
   a muon decay/capture took place.  Moreover, the code implemented a
   very poor model of what those distributions should look like - it was
   flat by target number and flat in time.  These generators have been 
   refactored to extract the common code and to put it into a new class,
      EventGenerator/inc/FoilParticleGenerator.hh 
      EventGenerator/src/FoilParticleGenerator.cc

   The generator was changed to make the distribution over targets proportional
   to the volume of the target and to make the distribution of time an exponential
   decay.  This is still not right but it is better.

   The following classes were modified to use the new class:
       ConversionGun, DecayInOrbitGun, EjectedProtonGun

1) October 18 2010, genser

     Factorized TTrackerMaker code, renamed variables pertaining to
     the sector/panel box to be consistent with the mu2e (and not G4)
     coordinate names), placed straws in the midle of the sector/panel
     box in the z direction, set sector/panel padding to 0
