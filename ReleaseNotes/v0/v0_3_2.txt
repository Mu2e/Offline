           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v0_3_2


1) February 4, 2011 kutschke
   I have made many changes the setup and build system. I have not
   changed any Mu2e code.  But if you use the new products area ( see below )
   you will get a newer version of Geant4, v4_9_3_p02 instead of p01.

   In prepartion for the future we have a new area for external products
   which does a better job of managing multiple builds of a single product;
   for example one framework verion has builds for SLF4/SLF5 and 64/32 bit
   hardware.  The setup system automatically detects the right choice of 
   SLF4/SLF5 and 64/32.  The old directory for external products still exists.
  
   To select the old externals area:
   source /grid/fermiapp/products/mu2e/setupmu2e.sh

   To select the new externals area:
   /grid/fermiapp/products/mu2e/setupmu2e-v1.sh

   The difference is -v1 at the end of the name.

   In both cases, the next steps remain the same:

   > cd Offline
   > source setup.sh
   > scons -j 4

   The new style externals will run on all of SLF4/SLF5 64/32 and I have tested
   on all but SLF5-32. 

   The old style externals will run only on SLF4 machines.

   I chose not to put the new g4 in the old externals and the old g4 in the
   new externals - this just did not seem necessary but if someone has a 
   compelling reason we can do it.

   A side effect of the above changes is that some of the environment variables
   that describe the include/ and lib/ areas of the external products have
   changed.  In the old system one specified, for example, the include and
   lib areas of HEPPDT by:
     ${HEPPDT_DIR}/include
     ${HEPPDT_DIR}/lib
   This no longer works because of a reorganization of the subdirectories.
   Instead one now must use:
      ${HEPPDT_INC}
      ${HEPPDT_LIB}

   Similary for many of the other products.

   To deal with this, all of the SConstruct and SConscript files were changed
   to use the new system and setup.sh was changed to define the missing
   X_INC and X_LIB environment variables, if necessary.

   Finally, the environment variable FRAMEWORK_DIR is now replaced by FW_HOME.

   Offline/setup.sh has been rewritten to be compatible with both the old and
   the new systems.  The backwards compatibility features will be removed 
   from setup.shas soon as people stop using the old style externals, which
   will hopefully be soon.

   setup.sh - choose appropriate version of G4
            - define any missing _INC and _LIB varibles.
   bin/setup_mu2e_project.sh     - use FW_HOME instead of FRAMWEORK_DIR
   SConstruct                    - use the new _INC and _LIB variables.
   Analyses/src/SConscript       - use the new _INC and _LIB variables.
   Mu2eG4/src/SConscript         - use the new _INC and _LIB variables.
   Mu2eReflection/src/SConscript - use the new _INC and _LIB variables.
