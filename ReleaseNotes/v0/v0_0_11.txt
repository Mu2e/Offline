           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v0_0_11


5) Mu2eG4/test/genconfig_05.txt
    Change the transverse size of the beam spot from 3 mm to 1 mm.
    ( To match the 3 mm radius of the production target ).

   Mu2eG4/inc/Mu2eWorld.hh
   Mu2eG4/src/Mu2eWorld.cc
     - Complete rewrite.
     - Fixes the infinite loop.
     - Refactor into many smaller functions.  Strip each function of superfluous local variables.
     - Remove the MECO concrete CRV shield
     - Remove the MECO steel return yoke/CRV shield. This will come back soon.
     - The muon beamline is now defined in Mu2e coordinates and is all placed inside 
       the hall, without nesting.
     - Flatten the heirarchy for the muon beamline.  Some components in the muon 
       beamline might nest inside each other today; they might not tomorrow.  So 
       place each in the "air inside hall" frame of reference.
     - Change the meaning of the Primary proton gun reference point.  It is now
       in the middle of the front face of the production target.  It was at the body
       center of the production target.
     - Fix the problem with memory leaking G4VisAttributes objects.
     - Remove magic numbers from code and move to geom_01.txt

   EventGenerator/src/PrimaryProtonGun.cc
   EventGenerator/inc/PrimaryProtonGun.hh
     - Make compatible with the new definition of the primary proton gun reference point.
     - The new version does not depend on the geometry of the production target.
     - The old version needed to know the length of the production target - which it
       did NOT get from the geometry file.  So this was an accident waiting to happen.

    Mu2eG4/test/geom_01.txt
     - Remove parameters made obsolete by the changes above. 
     - Add parameters that used to be magic numbers inside Mu2eWorld.cc

   Mu2eG4/inc/VolumeInfo.hh
   Mu2eG4/src/VolumeInfo.cc  (new file)
     - Added new data members to keep track of positions in the G4 world of nested
       objects.  This is a slightly dangerous thing since it does not properly keep
       track of rotations.

   Mu2eG4/inc/WorldInfo.hh
     - Change type of the solid data member from G4Box to G4VSolid (to work with nestBox).

   Mu2eG4/test/transportOnly.py
     - Use genconfig_tonly.txt instead of one of the standard ones.

   Mu2eG4/test/genconfig_tonly.txt ( new file)
     - Use conversiongun and primary proton gun.
     - Set beam spot size of the primary proton gun to zero so we always hit the
       target in the middle.
     - Later test code will use information made by the primary proton.

   Mods to HoughTransform/test/houghtest.py

2) May 25, 2010 rhbob
   Changes to calorimeter code.  Includes removing debug printout that appeared by default.
   This code is still underdevelopment and not ready for general use.

   Modify the graphics scripts and G4_plugin.cc to remove 
   unecessary redrawing of the scene.  It is now drawn
   once at the start of each event; it used to also be 
   drawn multiple times at the start of each job.
