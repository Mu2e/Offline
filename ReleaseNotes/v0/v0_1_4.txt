    EventGenerator/inc/DecayInOrbitGun.hh 
    EventGenerator/src/DecayInOrbitGun.cc
     - Now uses RandomNumberGeneratorService rather than the CLHEP global distributions.
     - This code was badly broken in many ways.  It is now fixed.
     - In the process of fixing it, I did a major reorganization.

   Mu2eUtilities/inc/RandomUnitSphere.hh
   Mu2eUtilities/src/RandomUnitSphere.cc
    - Now uses RandomNumberGeneratorService rather than the CLHEP global distributions.
    - Renamed shoot to fire to follow standard usage.
    - Keep shoot around as a depracted method for a while - it just calls fire.
    - Added second fire method that lets you change the magnitude of the vector.
    - Added a new c'tor that takes a reference to an engine.

   EventGenerator/src/ConversionGun.cc
   EventGenerator/inc/ConversionGun.hh
    - Change use of CLHEP::RandFlat::shoot() to using fire() from
      a local instance of RandFlat, that is constructed using the
      per module engine.

   EventGenerator/src/EventGenerator_plugin.cc
    - Pass seed from pSet to createEngine.
  
   Mu2eG4/test/g4test_03.py
    - Change seed to be different than that for G4.

   EventGenerator/inc/GeneratorBase.hh
   EventGenerator/src/GeneratorBase.cc
     - Add  getEngine() method.

   ToyDP/inc/GenId.hh
    - Need to include <iostream>, not just <ostream>, to get std::cout.

   Mu2eG4/test/drop.py   
     - This now does what it was advertised to do.
   Mu2eG4/test/replayAll.py
   Mu2eG4/test/replayWithSkip.py
     - These now read in the file made by drop.py

3) August 17, 2010 kutschke
    - Change the following .py files to use the new RandomNumberGeneratorService.
    - Still need to change all of the non-G4 modules that use random numbers.

   Mu2eG4/src/G4_plugin.cc
    - Using the new RandomNumberGeneratorService, seed the random number 
      engine used by G4.

1) August 17, 2010 wb

   The RandomNumberService that was a mu2e package has been replaced by 
   RandomNumberGeneratorService that is part of the framework.  Note that the
   name of the service has changed.  

   The obsolete code removed from the framework is:
     RandomNumberService/ ( the entire directory tree)
     GeneralUtilities/inc/vectorTransform.hh
     ToyDP/inc/RandomEngineState.hh

   The modified code is described below.  In addition to the modifications specific
   to the job at hand, the following was done to some of the files:
     - Remove unnecessary headers.
     - Reorder headers when needed.
     - In constructors, move assignments to intializer lists when possible.
     - Change some small code fragments to follow standard idioms.
     - Commenting the end of some } or #endif blocks

   setup.sh
     - Change to version 1_1_0 of the framework.

   ToyDP/src/classes.h
   ToyDP/src/classes_def.xml
     - Remove everything related to mu2e::RandomEngineState.
     - The corresponding functionality now comes from the framework.

   EventGenerator/src/EventGenerator_plugin.cc
     - Add call to createEengine, taking the default seed.

   EventGenerator/inc/CosmicDYB.hh
   EventGenerator/src/CosmicDYB.cc
     - Syntax change to access the service.
       ( Need to change this to global to repeat behaviour ).

   EffyNoise/src/SimpleEffyNoise_plugin.cc
     - Syntax change to access the service.

   Mu2eG4/test/g4test_03.py 
    - New name for the service
    - seeds now live in the PSets for each module, not in the PSet for the service

   Mu2eG4/test/replayAll.py
   Mu2eG4/test/replayWithSkip.py
    - New name for the service
    - Need to distinguish module labels from those in the original job.
