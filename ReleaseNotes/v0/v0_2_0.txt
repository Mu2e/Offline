    When finished, this class will read tracks from a text file in the format that is
    used for input to G4beamline.  It will add them to the event.
     EventGenerator/inc/FromG4BLFile.hh 
     EventGenerator/src/FromG4BLFile.cc

12) August 30, 2010, kutschke
    Add services to profile used cpu time and memory usage.  Both on by default.
     Mu2eG4/test/g4test_03.py

11) August 30, 2010, kutschke
    Add list of tracks for which to make printout (within selected events). 
    The list is specified in geom_01.txt and is processed inside SteppingAction.cc
      Mu2eG4/inc/SteppingAction.hh 
      Mu2eG4/src/SteppingAction.cc
      Mu2eG4/test/geom_01.txt

    Add a per event timer that is enabled whenever printout is enabled.  
    Add information to the end of track printout: proper time at which the
    particle stops; G4 global time and start and end of the particle; cpu and real
    time for processing the particel.  The resolution of the cpu/real timer is poor
    enough that most tracks show a time of 0.  This printout is still good for finding
    pathological tracks that take a very long time.

   setup.sh
     - Move to framework v1_1_3

   Mu2eG4/src/ReadBack.hh 
   Mu2eG4/src/ReadBack.cc
     - Add an example of how to use TGraphs.  You need
       to add them to the ROOT output file by hand.

   Allow multiple layers for the Aseet version of the TTracker.

   setup.sh
     - This file can now be used to establish the local area as a base release for use 
       with a test release in other disk space.
     - It defines and exports an envirnment variable, MU2E_BASE_RELEASE, that holds
       the current directory.
     - It uses this to: source ${MU2E_BASE_RELEASE}/bin/setup_mu2e_project.sh
       So one can source setup.sh from any directory.
     - It only builds the BaBar include directories only if the BaBar package is in the
       local area.

   Change the following to use RandGaussQ, not RandGauss.
    Example02/src/Ex02MakeHits_plugin.cc
     HitMakers/src/MakeCrudeStrawHit_plugin.cc

   Change post-increment to pre-increment.
     HitMakers/src/ReadStrawHit_plugin.cc

   Add missing <iomanip>
     HitMakers/src/MCSH_Test_plugin.cc

   In all of the above, plus the below, get rid of
   unnecessary includes and usings.
     HitMakers/src/ClusterHackv00_plugin.cc

5) August 26, 2010, kutschke
   KalmanTests/src/KalmanT01_plugin.cc
    Update to use RandomNumberGeneratorService
    Change to use RandGaussQ, not RandGauss.
    Not yet properly tested.

4) August 26, 2010, kutschke
   HitMakers/src/ReadStrawHit_plugin.cc
   HitMakers/test/read.py
     Make the name of the hit maker module a ParameterSet parameter.
     Get rid of the string "crude" everywhere ( a left over
     from MakeCrudeStrawHit_plugin on which this was modelled).

3) August 26, 2010, kutschke
   HitMakers/src/MakeStrawHit_plugin.cc
   HitMakers/test/makehits.py
     Update to use RandomNumberGeneratorService
     Make the name of the g4 module a ParameterSet parameter.
     Get rid of the string "crude" everywhere ( a left over
     from MakeCrudeStrawHit_plugin on which this was modelled).

   setup.sh
     setup framework v1_1_2
     This, in turn, requires externals from 
     /grid/fermiapp/products/mu2e.  We are no longer
     putting new versions into /prj/mu2e/externals.
