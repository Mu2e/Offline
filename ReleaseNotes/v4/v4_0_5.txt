           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v4_0_5

   setup.sh
    - Add -B option
    - Use the + syntax on qualifiers

   Splines is built against the wrong version of cpp0x.
   We can probably live with this for now.

   The comparison operators for Ptr<T> have changed. These files had to
   be changed to work around:

     HitMakers/src/MakeExtMonUCITofHits_module.cc
     KalmanTests/src/KalFitMC.cc
     TrkPatRec/src/FlagBkgHits_module.cc


   A) Given:
   Ptr<T> p = ....;

   This no longer works:
   if ( p != 0 )

   Replace it with:

   if ( p )

   This fixes some unintended automatic conversions that produce incorrect
   behaviour if the pointee data product has been dropped from the event.

   B)
   There is an oversight that will be fixed in the next release.
   Operator != is missing for Ptr<T>.

   Given:
   Ptr<T> p, q;

   This fails:
   if ( p != q )

   Instead use:

   if ( !(p == q) )

   With the new version of art, all analyzer modules must pass the
   parameter set to a new c'tor of the base class:
   Foo::Foo( fhicl::ParameterSet const& pset){}

   Becomes:
   Foo::Foo( fhicl::ParameterSet const& pset)
     : EDAnalyzer(pset){}
