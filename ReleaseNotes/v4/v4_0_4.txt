   Added the support structure of the stopping target. The support structure is composed
   of wires connecting the target foils with the outer proton absorber.
   Added new parameters to geom_01.txt to control the support structure: 
        bool   stoppingTarget.foilTarget_supportStructure
        int    stoppingTarget.foilTarget_supportStructure_number
        double stoppingTarget.foilTarget_supportStructure_angleOffset
        double stoppingTarget.foilTarget_supportStructure_radius
        string stoppingTarget.foilTarget_supportStructure_fillMaterial
   Default values set to the nominal case of 3 wires of 0.0381mm radius made out of tungsten for each foil,
   with first wire along y-direction.

   Change INA and OPA material to 5% borated polyethylene.  Introduce new
   parts of INA (3 and 4) to help reduce tracker backgrounds. By default,
   INA3 and INA4 are material 'DSVacuum' and so have no effect.
