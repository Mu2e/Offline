           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v4_0_2

   Implement and use a new G4_module functionality to merge
   StepPointMCs simulated in earlier stages into outputs of the
   current simulation stage.

   Do not stack neutrinos (geom_01 change).  This reduces disk space
   for the first stage of production by  a factor of 3.5.

   Implement and use a new FilterG4Out functionality to write out muon
   stops into a framework format file.

   Modify the Kalman filter fit parameters governing the magnetic
   field correction to make bigger steps.
