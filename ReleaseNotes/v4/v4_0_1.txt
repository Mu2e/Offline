   Changes in preparation for making the new tracker support model the default.
   The new tracker support model takes more space than the old one ( which was less
   detailed). I need to move a few things to make room.  This is up for review later.

   Mu2eG4/test/DetectorSolenoid_v02.txt
    - Moved the DS2/3 boundary upstream by 300 mm.

   Mu2eG4/test/protonAbsorber_conical_v2.txt
     - Shortened the outer proton absorber by 61 mm;
     - I kept the upstream end unchanged
     - I shortened the length and reduced the radius at the downstream end to preserve
       the pitch.

   Switch the default physics list to Shielding_MU2E01.

5) October 5, 2013 gandr
   Switch the default BField interpolation alorithm to trilinear.

   G4 seems to interpret proper time of G4PrimaryParticle as
   "PreAssignedDecayProperTime", which leads to incorrect decay times.
   Do not call the G4PrimaryParticle::SetProperTime() method.

   Use G4_POLYETHYLENE (density 0.94 g/cm3) instead of Polyethylene092
   for TS3 collimator, TS5 collimator, and the poly liner.

2) October 3, 2013 gandr
   Changed TS3 collimator material from G4_Cu to Polyethylene092
   per today's e-mails.

   Increase the world margins.  Getting to a few percent accuracy the
   flux of neutrons that reflect back should be good enough,
   and 5 meters of dirt is a safe choice according to Vitaly.
