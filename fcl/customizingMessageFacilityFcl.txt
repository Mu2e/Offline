      Some Examples of Customizing the MessageFacility in an fcl File
      ---------------------------------------------------------------
      
Example 1: We want INFO level of messages (we will select interactive)
           but one category of message, namely "chatter" would appear
	   annoyingly often; we wish to set a limit of zero so as to 
	   completely throttle all instances of "chatter" messages.
	   
#include "fcl/messageService.fcl"

services :
{
  # perhaps some configuration unrelated to MessageFacility
  
  message : @local::mf_interactive
  message.destinations.log.categories.chatter.limit : 0
  
  # and perhaps more configuration unrelated to MessageFacility
}

Example 2: We want the functionallity of the batch choice, but prefer that
           the name of the log file be "myFileName.log" instead of 
	   warning.log.  We still want the statistics to go to the same 
	   file as the messages.
	   
#include "fcl/messageService.fcl"

services :
{
  # perhaps some configuration unrelated to MessageFacility
  
  message : @local::mf_batch
  message.destinations.log.filename : "myFileName.log"
  message.statistics.stats.filename : "myFileName.log"
  
  # and perhaps more configuration unrelated to MessageFacility
}

Example 3: We want the debugging choice, but only want LogDebug output from
           two modules, module_A and module_B.
	   
#include "fcl/messageService.fcl"

services :
{
  # perhaps some configuration unrelated to MessageFacility
  
  message : @local::mf_debugging
  message.debugModules : [ module_A, module_B ]
  
  # and perhaps more configuration unrelated to MessageFacility
}

Example 4: We want the debugging choice, with all the LogDebug output 
	   **except** those LogDebug messages coming from from module_X.
	   
#include "fcl/messageService.fcl"

services :
{
  # perhaps some configuration unrelated to MessageFacility
  
  message : @local::mf_debugging
  message.suppressDebug : [ module_X ]
  
  # and perhaps more configuration unrelated to MessageFacility
}

Example 5: We want two separate log files, one with only the LogError level
	   messages, and one more verbose with LogInfo and above, going
	   to cout, exactly as if choosing the interactive configuration.  
	   That is, we just wish to have one additoinal (standard) destination. 
	   
#include "fcl/messageService.fcl"

services :
{
  # perhaps some configuration unrelated to MessageFacility
  
  message : @local::mf_error
  message.destinations.verboselog: @local::mf_coutInfo
  
  # and perhaps more configuration unrelated to MessageFacility
}

Example 6: We want two separate log files, one with only the LogError level
	   messages, and one more verbose with LogInfo and above, exactly
	   as if choosing the interactive configuration.  We would like the
	   output for the latter to go into info.log rather than to cout.
	   And we want the message statistics to go only into the more 
	   verbose file info.log.
	   
#include "fcl/messageService.fcl"

services :
{
  # perhaps some configuration unrelated to MessageFacility
  
  message : @local::mf_error
  message.log.statistics : { }       # eliminate statistics in log
  message.destinations.verboselog: @local::mf_coutInfo
  message.destinations.verboselog.type : file
  message.destinations.verboselog.filename : "info.log"
  message.statistics.vervboselog.statistics:
  {
    type     : file
    filename : "info.log"
  } 
  
  # and perhaps more configuration unrelated to MessageFacility
}
