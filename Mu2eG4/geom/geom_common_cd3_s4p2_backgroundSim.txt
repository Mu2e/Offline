// Special geometry file for simulating background frames; in particular
// for stage 4 of the beam simulations
//
// At present the tracker is designed as a 20 station device but the baseline
// plan is leave 2 stations empty; should funding become available the other
// two stations will be populated.
//
// As we did for the TDR, the background frames will be simulated with a
// 20 station tracker. We will generate high statistics signal and DIO tail
// files with both 18 and 20 station trackers.  When we mix 20 station
// background frames onto 18 station signal, the hit maker code will simply
// ignore StepPointMCs from the missing stations.
